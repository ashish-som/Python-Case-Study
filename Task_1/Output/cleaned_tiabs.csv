1,"Viral lower respiratory tract infections and preterm infants healthcare utilisation The aim of this study was to determine whether respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and other viral lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in prematurely born infants were associated with similar effects on healthcare utilisation and related cost of care in the second compared to the first year after birth. Thirteen infants who had RSV LRTIs (RSV), 21 who had other viral LRTIs (other viral) and 25 had no viral LRTIs (no LRTI) were prospectively followed. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected whenever an infant had an LRTI regardless of whether it was in the hospital or in the community. Healthcare utilisation and the health-related cost of care were determined. Only the RSV group compared to the no LRTI group had higher overall respiratory costs in both year 1 (mean, 3,917 versus 24; p < 0.041) and year 2 (mean, 1,164 versus 61; p = 0.012). Only the RSV group required respiratory admissions; the RSV admission rate in year 2 was 3.4 % (number needed to treat 59). Conclusion: RSV LRTIs are associated with increased healthcare utilisation and cost of care in the first and second year; nevertheless, if prophylaxis is to be cost-effective in the second year, a high risk group needs to be identified.

2,"Incidence of respiratory syncytial virus related health care utilization in the United States Background: Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is one of the most frequent causes of acute respiratory infection worldwide. Understanding age-specific health care utilization is necessary to guide effective prevention strategies. This retrospective database analysis assessed the incidence rates of RSV-related health care utilization in the USA over a 7-year period. Methods: Episodes of RSV were identified in the Truven Health MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters database between 2008 and 2014 using ICD-9-CM codes for pneumonia, bronchiolitis and RSV (480-486, 487.0, 466.1, 491.2, 079.6). Annual RSV-related health care utilization was calculated for the total population, by age group (<1, 1, 2-4, 5-17, 18-49, 50-64, 65-74, 75-84 and 85 years) and the proportion of cases for each setting (hospitalization, outpatient, or emergency department [ED] / urgent care [UC]). Results: Over the 7-year study period, the mean rate of all RSV-associated health care utilization was 2.4 per 1000 person-years, with mean rates ranging from 2.0 to 2.6). The highest rate was seen in infants aged <1 year (mean 79.0 per 1000 over the 7-year period), which decreased with increasing age in the range 2-49 years before increasing with age in older adults (mean rate 8.1 per 1000 over the 7-year period in those 85 years). Of all RSV cases, 82% were reported in an outpatient setting, 11% in the ED/UC and 7% were hospitalized. Conclusions: The annual RSV-related healthcare utilization rates were substantial, especially in infants and young children. These results underscore the need to accelerate the development of RSV prevention strategies to reduce the healthcare burden of RSV. (Tong S.) IVIDATA Stats, France. , (Amand C.)

3,"Long-term assessment of healthcare utilization 5 years after respiratory syncytial virus infection in US infants Background. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the primary cause of respiratory tract infections in infants; however, current burden estimates report only the short-term effects of acute infection. Methods. Infants with RSV infection and 24 months of continuous enrollment were retrospectively identified from the Truven MarketScan database (1 January 2004-30 September 2015). Exposed infants (n = 38 473) were propensity score matched to nonexposed controls (n = 76 825) by baseline characteristics and gestational age. Five-year cumulative all-cause, asthma/wheezing, and respiratory event-related hospitalization rates and physician and emergency department healthcare-resource utilization rates were assessed. Results. During follow-up, RSV-infected cohorts had higher average all-cause cumulative hospitalization rates, compared with controls, with values of 79.9 hospitalizations/100 patient-years (95% confidence interval [CI], 41.7-118.2) for 213 early premature infants (P <.001), 18.2 hospitalizations/100 patient-years (95% CI,.8-35.7) for 397 premature infants (P =.04), 34.2 hospitalizations/100 patient-years (95% CI, 29.1-39.2) for 4446 late premature infants (P <.001), and 16.1 hospitalizations/100 patient-years (95% CI, 14.9-17.4) for 33 417 full-term infants (P <.001). Cumulative rates of physician and emergency department visits were also higher for RSV-infected infants. Asthma/wheezing accounted for 10%-18% of total 5-year physician visits. Conclusions. Infant RSV infection has a significant long-term healthcare-resource utilization impact across gestational ages for at least 5 years after infection, most of it in the first 2 years. Systematically collecting healthcare-resource utilization data will be important for cost-effectiveness evaluations of RSV interventions in planned or ongoing trials.

4,"Health care utilisation of infants with chronic lung disease, related to hospitalisation for RSV infection Aims - To compare the use of health care resources and associated costs between infants with chronic lung disease (CLD) who had or had not an admission with a proven respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. Methods - Review of community care, outpatient attendances, and readmissions in the first two years after birth. Patients: 235 infants (median gestational age 27 weeks) evaluated in four groups: 45 infants with a proven RSV admission (RSV proven); 24 with a probable bronchiolitis admission; 60 with other respiratory admissions; and 106 with non-respiratory or no admissions. Results - The RSV proven compared to the other groups required more frequent and longer admissions to general paediatric wards and intensive care units, more outpatient attendances and GP consultations for respiratory related disorders, and had a higher total cost of care. Conclusion - RSV hospitalisation in patients with CLD is associated with increased health service utilisation and costs in the first two years after birth.

5,"Health Care Resource Utilization of Late Premature Versus Term Infants With Bronchiolitis It is controversial whether it is cost-beneficial for late preterm infants to receive respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis. This study compares community and hospital health care resource utilization (HCRU) of late premature infants (33-36 weeks gestational age) with term infants (>36 weeks gestational age) hospitalized with bronchiolitis. This was a retrospective, population-based, observational study spanning a 9-year period (2004-2012). HCRU data were obtained from the Health Maintenance Organization Clalit and included duration of hospitalization, physician visits, laboratory tests, and treatments. Compared with term infants, late preterm infants had significantly longer duration of hospitalization and higher admission rates to pediatric intensive care unit. They also had higher rates of mean outpatients clinic visits, total outpatient clinic and specialist visits, blood chemistry, and virology testing. HCRU of term infants with bronchiolitis was also substantial, indicating that they also can greatly benefit from respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis. These findings can guide stakeholders in decisions concerning the prevention of bronchiolitis and will be useful in performing further cost-benefit analysis.

6,"Rhinovirus infection and healthcare utilisation in prematurely born infants Our aim was to determine whether rhinovirus (RV) lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in prematurely born infants increase health-related cost of care during infancy. 153 infants born at <36 weeks of gestation were prospectively followed to 1 year. Cost of care was calculated from the National Health Service reference costing scheme and healthcare utilisation determined by examining hospital/general practitioner records. 20 infants developed RV LRTIs (RV group), 17 respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) LRTIs (RSV group), 12 both RV and RSV LRTIs (RV/RSV group) and 74 had no LRTI (no LRTI group). Compared with the no LRTI group, the RV/RSV LRTI group had the greatest increase in adjusted mean cost (difference GBP 5769), followed by the RV LRTI group (difference GBP 278) and, finally, the RSV LRTI group (difference GBP 172) (p=0.045). The RV group had more outpatient (p<0.05) and respiratory-related general practitioner (p<0.05) attendances, more wheezed at follow-up (p<0.001) than the no LRTI group and more had respiratory-related outpatient attendances than the RSV LRTI group (p<0.05). We conclude that RV LRTIs were associated with increased health-related cost of care during infancy; our results suggest that the RV group compared with the RSV group suffered greater chronic respiratory morbidity.

7,"Increased healthcare resource utilization for acute respiratory illness among Latino infants Objective: To examine healthcare resource utilization for acute respiratory illness in Latino infants compared with other racial/ethnic groups. Study design: We studied 674 term-born, previously healthy infants brought in for an unscheduled healthcare visit for an acute respiratory illness. The predictor variable was infant race/ethnicity, and the primary outcome was healthcare resource utilization, adjusted for age and disease severity. Results: The cohort was 14% Latino, 52% white, 22% African American, and 12% other race/ethnicity. More than one-third (37%) of the mothers of Latino infants were Spanish-speaking. The bronchiolitis severity score was higher (indicating more severe disease) in white infants (median, 6.0; IQR, 3.0-9.0 on a scale of 0-12) compared with Latino (median, 3.0; IQR, 1.0-6.0) and African American (median, 3.5; IQR, 1.0-6.0) infants (P <.001 for the comparison of all groups). Disease severity was similar in Latino and African American infants (P =.96). Latino infants were the most likely to receive antibiotics (58%, compared with 47% of whites and 34% of African Americans; P =.005) and to have body fluid cultures drawn. Latino infants also were more likely than African American infants to undergo chest radiography and respiratory virus rapid antigen testing (P .01). Latino infants from Spanish-speaking families had a higher rate of respiratory syncytial virus testing compared with those from English-speaking families (76% vs 51%; P =.016). Conclusion: Providers caring for Latino infants with acute respiratory illness ordered more antibiotics and diagnostic testing for this group, particularly compared with African Americans, even though the 2 groups had similar disease severity and socioeconomic disparities. Language barrier may be a possible explanation for these differences. Copyright  2013 Mosby Inc. All rights reserved. (Valet R.S.; Minton P.A.; Woodward K.B.; Hartert T.V.)

8,"RSV hospitalisation and healthcare utilisation in moderately prematurely born infants Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is associated with chronic respiratory morbidity in infants born very prematurely. Our aims were to determine if infants born moderately prematurely (32-35 weeks of gestation) who had had an RSV hospitalisation, compared to those who had not, had greater healthcare utilisation and related cost of care in the first 2 years. Two thousand and sixty-six eligible infants' records were examined to identify three groups: 20 infants admitted for an RSV lower respiratory tract infection (RSV),30 admitted for another respiratory problem (other respiratory) and 108 admitted for a nonrespiratory problem/never admitted (non-respiratory). Healthcare utilisation was assessed by examining hospital and general practitioner records and cost of care calculated using the National Scheme of Reference costs and the British National Formulary prices. The mean cost of care in the RSV group (12,505) was greater than the non-respiratory (1, 178) (95% CI for difference 5, 015 to 17,639, p0 0.002) and the other respiratory (3,356) groups (95% CI for difference 2,963 to 15,606, p<0.001). The adjusted mean differences in the cost of care were 11, 186 between the RSV and non-respiratory groups (95% CI 4,763 to 17,609) and 9, 076 (95% CI 2,515 to 15,637) between the RSV and the other respiratory groups. Forty-two of 2, 066 eligible infants had an RSV hospitalisation (2%); thus, assuming prophylaxis would reduce the hospitalisation rate by 50%, the number needed to treat was 98. In conclusion, RSV hospitalisation in moderately prematurely born infants is associated with increased health-related cost of care. Nevertheless, if RSV prophylaxis is to be costeffective, a high risk group of moderately prematurely born infants needs to be identified.  2011 Springer-Verlag.

9,"Healthcare resource use and economic burden attributable to respiratory syncytial virus in the United States: a claims database analysis BACKGROUND: Despite several studies that have estimated the economic impact of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) in infants, limited data are available on healthcare resource use and costs attributable to RSV across age groups. The aim of this study was to quantify age-specific RSV-related healthcare resource use and costs on the US healthcare system. METHODS: This retrospective case-control study identified patients aged 1 year with an RSV event in the Truven Health Marketscan Commercial Claims and Encounters and Medicare Supplemental and Coordination of Benefits databases between August 31, 2012 and August 1, 2013. RSV patients were matched 1:1 with non-RSV controls for age, gender, region, healthcare plan and index date (n = 11,432 in each group). Stratified analyses for healthcare resource use and costs were conducted by age groups. RSV-attributable resource use and costs were assessed based on the incremental differences between RSV cases and controls using multivariate analysis. RESULTS: RSV patients had a higher healthcare resource use (hospital stays, emergency room/urgent care visits, ambulatory visits and outpatient visits) than non-RSV matched controls for all age groups (all p < 0.0001), particularly in the elderly age groups with RSV (1.9 to 3 days length of stay, 0.4 to 0.5 more ER/UC visits, 0.7 to 2.7 more ambulatory visits, 12.1 to 18.6 more outpatient visits and 9.5 to 14.6 more prescriptions than elderly in the control groups). The incremental difference in adjusted mean annual costs between RSV and non-RSV controls was higher in elderly (65; $12,030 to $23,194) than in those aged < 65 years ($2251 to $5391). Among children, adjusted costs attributable to RSV were higher in children aged 5-17 years ($3192), than those 1-4 years ($2251 to $2521). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed a substantial annual RSV-attributable healthcare resource use and costs in the US across age groups, with the highest burden in those aged 65 years. These data can be used in cost-effectiveness analyses, and may be useful for policymakers to guide future RSV vaccination and other prevention programs. (Amand C.)

10,"Health care utilisation of prematurely born, preschool children related to hospitalisation for RSV infection Background: In prematurely born infants with chronic lung disease (CLD), RSV hospitalisation is associated with increased health service utilisation and costs in the first two years after birth. Aims: To determine whether RSV hospitalisation in the first two years was associated with chronic respiratory morbidity during the preschool years in prematurely born children who had had CLD. Methods: Retrospective review of readmissions, outpatient attendances, and community care in years 2-4 and, at age 5 years, assessment of the children's respiratory status and their health related quality of life. Comparison was made of the results of children who had had at least one hospitalisation in the first two years after birth for RSV infection (RSV group) to those of the rest of the cohort. Participants were 190 of an original cohort of 235 infants with CLD and a median gestational age 27 (range 22-33) weeks. Results: The 33 children in the RSV group, compared to the rest of the cohort, had a greater duration of hospital stay and more outpatient appointments. The RSV group had required more prescriptions for all treatments and respiratory medications, and more had used an inhaler. The cost of care of the RSV group was higher (median 2630 [4000, US$4800], range 124-18 091 versus 1360 [2500, US$3000], range 5-18 929) and their health related quality of life was lower. Conclusion: In prematurely born children who had developed CLD, RSV hospitalisation in the first two years was associated with chronic respiratory morbidity and increased cost of care.

11,"Healthcare resource utilization and costs in the 12 months following hospitalization for respiratory syncytial virus or unspecified bronchiolitis among infants Aims: To examine healthcare resource utilization (HRU) and costs within 12 months after hospitalization for respiratory syncytial virus (RSVH) or unspecified bronchiolitis (UBH) in infants. Materials and methods: Infants born July 1, 2009June 30, 2015 were identified in the MarketScan Medicaid and Commercial databases and were assigned to one of three cohorts: RSVH (with/without UBH), UBH, or comparator (no RSVH or UBH). Each infant was identified as pre-term (5 groups) or term (2 groups) based on weeks gestational age (wGA). Index dates were the first admission dates for RSVH or UBH infants and were randomly assigned to comparator infants based on time from birth to index in the RSVH cohort. HRU, all-cause costs, and incremental cost differences between hospitalized and comparator infants were assessed over 12 months post-index with and without the index hospitalization. Results were propensity score weighted to balance pre-index characteristics across hospitalization cohorts. Results: This study identified 15,872 RSVH infants, 6,081 UBH infants, and 986,087 comparator infants in the Medicaid population and 5,755 RSVH infants, 1,888 UBH infants, and 696,302 comparator infants in the commercial population. HRU in follow-up was greater for RSVH and UBH infants relative to comparator infants in both populations, including hospitalizations (commercial: 7.4%, 11.0%, 1.7%; Medicaid_ 12.3%, 15.3%, 3.2%) and emergency department visits (commercial: 33.0%, 33.3%, 17.2%; Medicaid_ 65.8%, 68.5%, 51.4%). HRU was highest among RSVH and UBH infants born at <29 wGA. Hospitalized infants had numerically higher follow-up costs than comparator infants, with incremental differences reaching $19,896 among Medicaid UBH infants and $37,417 among commercial RSVH infants. Limitations: RSV/UB may be miscoded in claims data. Conclusions: Infants hospitalized for RSV or UB largely had greater subsequent HRU and costs in the first year after index hospitalization than comparator infants. Absolute and incremental follow-up costs relative to comparator infants were highest among infants <29 wGA. (Ledbetter J.)

12,"Influenza-like illness in residential care homes: A study of the incidence, aetiological agents, natural history and health resource utilisation Background: Influenza-like illness (ILI) among elderly people living in residential care homes (RCHEs) is a common cause for hospitalisation. A study was undertaken to examine the incidence, underlying aetiology, natural history and associated healthcare resource utilisation related to ILI in the RCHE population. Methods: A prospective study of ILI in four RCHEs in Shatin, Hong Kong was conducted from April 2006 to March 2007. Each RCHE was monitored daily for the occurrence of ILI and followed up until resolution of illness or death. Clinical features were recorded and sputum, nasopharyngeal aspirate, blood and urine specimens were examined for underlying aetiology. Results: 259 episodes of ILI occurred in 194 subjects, with mild peaks in winter and summer, over a sustained level throughout the year. The infectious agent was identified in 61.4% of all episodes, comprising bacterial infection in 53.3% and viral in 46.7%. Multiple infections occurred in 16.2% of subjects. The most frequent organism was Streptococcus pneumoniae, followed by respiratory syncytial virus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, metapneumovirus and parainfluenza virus types 1 and 3. Clinical features did not vary according to the underlying aetiology, the common presenting features being a decrease in general condition, cognitive and functional deterioration, and withholding of food in addition to fever and respiratory symptoms. Overall, mortality at 1 month/discharge was 9.7%. Infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, low body mass index and poor function predisposed to mortality. No association was observed between influenza vaccination status and underlying aetiology, clinical features or outcome. Conclusions: The clinical presentation of ILI is non-specific and is mainly due to bacterial and viral infections other than influenza in the RCHE population.

13,"Respiratory Syncytial Virus Burden and Healthcare Utilization in United States Infants <1 Year of Age: Study of Nationally Representative Databases, 2011-2019 Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of hospitalizations in United States infants aged <1 year, but research has focused on select populations. Methods: National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample and National Emergency Department (ED) Sample data (2011-2019) were used to report RSV hospitalization (RSVH), bronchiolitis hospitalization (BH), and ED visit counts, percentage of total hospitalizations/visits, and rates per 1000 live births along with inpatient mortality, mechanical ventilation (MV), and total charges (2020 US dollars). Results: Average annual RSVH and RSV ED visits were 56 927 (range, 43 845-66 155) and 131 999 (range, 89 809-177 680), respectively. RSVH rates remained constant over time (P =. 5), whereas ED visit rates increased (P =. 004). From 2011 through 2019, Medicaid infants had the highest average rates (RSVH: 22.3 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 21.5-23.1] per 1000; ED visits: 55.9 [95% CI, 52.4-59.4] per 1000) compared to infants with private or other/unknown insurance (RSVH: P <. 0001; ED visits: P <. 0001). From 2011 through 2019, for all races and ethnicities, Medicaid infants had higher average RSVH rates (up to 7 times) compared to infants with private or other/unknown insurance. RSVH mortality remained constant over time (P =. 8), whereas MV use (2019: 13% of RSVH, P <. 0001) and mean charge during hospitalization (2019: $21 513, P <. 0001) increased. Bronchiolitis patterns were similar. Conclusions: This study highlights the importance of ensuring access to RSV preventive measures for all infants.

14,"Comparison of health care resource utilization among preterm and term infants hospitalized with Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus infections: A systematic review and meta-analysis of retrospective cohort studies Introduction Data on the variation in the medical resource utilization rate of Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus (HRSV) infected children by gestational age have recently been made available. This review aimed to determine whether prematurity is independently associated with the use of medical resources in hospitalized children for HRSV infections. Methods We conducted this systematic review on cohort studies published on the medical resources use in preterm and full-term patients hospitalized for confirmed HRSV infections. We searched PubMed, Embase, and Global Index medicus for eligible studies. The standardized mean difference (SMD) and Risk Ratio (RR) with their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated as summary statistics with random effects meta-analysis. The overall results were adjusted to the common confounders by stratified analyses. Results A total of 14 articles (20 studies) were included. Compared to full-term, preterm hospitalized with HRSV infections had more frequent intensive care unit admission (RR = 2.6, 95% CI = 1.93.5), increased length of stay in hospital (SMD = 0.6, 95% CI = 0.50.8) and intensive care unit (SMD = 0.6, 95% CI = 0.40.8) and increased case fatality rate (RR = 6.9, 95% CI = 2.023.8). Mechanical ventilation utilization was more frequent in preterm children  2 years (RR = 15.5, 95% CI = 8.926.4) and those who did not receive prophylaxis against HRSV (RR = 15.9, 95% CI = 9.127.9)] than in full-term children. No differences were identified in the frequency of emergency department visits, oxygen utilization, and the age at the first HRSV episode between preterm and full-term infants. Conclusions Regardless of gestational age, preterm infants hospitalized for HRSV infections, especially those  2 years, have an increased frequency of use of health resources and poor outcomes compared to full-term infants. HRSV vaccine development programs for pregnant women should be accelerated.

15,"Outcome of respiratory syncytial virus infection and a cost-benefit analysis of prophylaxis Objectives: To determine outcome and length of stay (LOS) for infants younger than 2 years of age admitted to hospital for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection and to perform a cost-benefit analysis of prophylaxis with RSV -globulin (Respigam; CSL Laboratories, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia) and monoclonal antibody (Synagis; Abbott Australasia, Kurnell, NSW, Australia) in the Australian context. Methods: Retrospective outcome study using data from an Australian hospital and intensive care databases over a 30 month period encompassing three RSV seasons (1 May 1997-31 October 1999). Results: The mortality for RSV infection was very low, being 0.29% of all patients admitted to hospital and 0% in infants without co-existing disease. Only 11.4% of infants required admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Respiratory syncytial virus infection was not associated with prolonged hospitalization; patients managed in the general wards had a mean length of stay (LOS) of 4.13 days with a median of 3.0 days, while those requiring intensive care had a mean LOS of 9.8 days (including 5.1 days in the ICU). Use of RSV prophylaxis would be expected to reduce the requirement for hospital admission; however, the cost of prophylaxis is conservatively estimated to be between 7.2- and 65.3-fold the money saved in hospital care, depending on the weight of the patient and choice of drug. Conclusions: Respiratory syncytial virus is a major cause of morbidity, but not mortality, in infants. In infants requiring hospitalization for this disease, the LOS is relatively short and the mortality extremely low. Use of prophylactic agents, which reduce the probability of hospital admission but have no effect on mortality, cannot be justified in the Australian context on cost-benefit grounds.

16,"Nosocomial respiratory syncytial virus infections: The cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit of infection control Objective. To determine the cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit of an infection control program to reduce nosocomial respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) transmission in a large pediatric hospital. Design. RSV nosocomial infection (NI) was studied for 8 years, before and after intervention with a targeted infection control program. The cost-effectiveness of the intervention was calculated, and cost-benefit was estimated by a case-control comparison. Setting. Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, a 304 bed pediatric hospital. Patients. All inpatients with RSV infection, both community- and hospital-acquired. Intervention. Consisted of early recognition of patients with respiratory symptoms, confirmation of RSV infection by laboratory testing, establishing cohorts of patients and nursing staff, gown and glove barrier precautions, and monitoring and education of staff. Outcome Measures. The incidence density of RSV NI before and after the intervention was calculated as the rate per 1000 patient days-at-risk for infection. Intervention costs included laboratory testing, isolation, and administration of the program. The cost of RSV NI was estimated by comparing hospital charges for 30 cases and matched uninfected controls. Results. A total of 148 patients acquired NI (88 before and 60 after the intervention). The Mantel-Haenszel stratified relative risk for NI in the period before the infection control program, compared with the postintervention period, was .61 (95% confidence interval: .53-.69). By applying the preintervention stratum-specific rates of infection to the days-at-risk in the postintervention period, an estimated 100 NIs would have been expected, which in comparison to the 60 NIs observed, yielded an estimated program effectiveness of 10 RSV NIs prevented per season. The total cost of the program per season was $15 627 or $1563/NI prevented. In comparison, the mean cost to the hospital was $9419/case of RSV NI, resulting in a cost-benefit ratio of 1:6. Conclusions. A targeted infection control intervention was cost-effective in reducing the rate of RSV NI. For every dollar spent on the program, approximately $6 was saved.

17,"A comparison of healthcare resource use for rotavirus and RSV between vulnerable children with co-morbidities and healthy children: A case control study Objective: To quantify the differences in hospital length of stay (LOS) and cost between healthy and vulnerable children with cystic fibrosis (CF), insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), cancer, and epilepsy who contract rotavirus (RVGE) or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Methods: Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data were collected for England, for children <5 years old, admitted between April 2001 and March 2008, using ICD-10 codes for RVGE and RSV. Cases were identified as having RVGE and/or RSV plus CF, IDDM, cancer, or epilepsy. Healthy controls had RVGE and/or RSV only, additional controls had eczema only. Cost, hospital LOS, and demographics were collected. Results: Four hundred and eighty-six (0.5%) cases and 101,784 (99.5%) healthy controls were admitted with RVGE or RSV, with 17,420 eczema controls. RVGE was present in 153 (31.5%) cases and 7532 (7.4%) healthy controls, and RSV in 333 (68.5%) cases and 94,252 (92.6%) healthy controls. Cases were older (1.1 years, SD=1.3 years), had greater LOS (9.9 days, SD=19.9), and cost more (3477, SD=7765) than healthy controls (age=0.2, SD=0.5, p<0.001; LOS=1.9 days, SD=3.1, p<0.001; cost=595, SD=727, p<0.001). Cost for cases was 6-times greater than healthy controls (p<0.001). Controls had a 0.3 day greater LOS (p<0.001) with RSV, but a 17 (p=0.085) lower mean cost than RVGE. Conclusion: RVGE and RSV are more serious diseases in vulnerable children, requiring more intense resource use. The importance of preventing infection in vulnerable children is underlined by hygiene and appropriate isolation and vaccination strategies. When universal vaccination is under consideration, as for rotavirus vaccines, evaluation of a vaccination programme should consider the potentially positive impact on vulnerable children. Limitations: Limitations of the study include a dependency on accurate coding, an expectation that patients are identified through laboratory testing, and the possibility of unidentified underlying conditions affecting the burden.  2013 Informa UK Ltd.

18,"A Real-World Analysis of Patient Characteristics and Predictors of Hospitalization Among US Medicare Beneficiaries with Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection Introduction: Little has been published on respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) among Medicare patients at high risk (HR) of RSV complications due to age or comorbidity. Methods: Adult patients (at least 18 years of age) with at least 1 diagnostic code for RSV were identified using the 5% US Medicare database from 2011 through 2015. Patients were required to have continuous health plan enrollment for 180 days pre- and 180 days post-RSV diagnosis (baseline and follow-up periods, respectively). HR was defined as diagnosis of chronic lung disease, congestive heart failure, or weakened immune system for 180 days during the baseline period. Patients were categorized as initially hospitalized if hospitalized within 1 day of RSV diagnosis. Logistic regression models were developed to determine predictors of initial hospitalization. Healthcare utilization and costs for 180 days pre- and post-RSV diagnosis were compared. Results: The study included 756 HR patients who were initially hospitalized with RSV diagnoses. Among these, 61.7% were diagnosed in the emergency department vs 15.3% in a physicians office, with hypertension (76.3%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (53.7%), and high cholesterol (52.0%) observed as the most prevalent comorbidities. Of these, COPD, congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and previous evidence of pneumonia were significant predictors of hospitalization. Other significant predictors of hospitalization included older age, hematological malignancies, stroke, and baseline healthcare resource use. Among both HR and non-HR hospitalized patients, there was a significant increase in healthcare resource utilization following hospitalization, including the number of inpatient admissions and longer hospital stays post-RSV diagnosis. The total mean all-cause healthcare costs among HR hospitalized patients increased by $9210 per patient (p < 0.0001) post-RSV diagnosis. Conclusion: Hospitalized Medicare beneficiaries with RSV infections pose a significant healthcare burden as compared with non-hospitalized patients, mainly driven by higher comorbidity, higher likelihood of multiple inpatient admissions, and costly medical interventions.

19,"A cost-benefit analysis of the immunisation of children against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) using the English Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common cause of respiratory infection that is highly prevalent in infants, particularly those with underlying medical conditions. Severe cases of RSV require hospitalisation as well as admission to intensive care and may even result in death. The objective of the study was to measure the net benefits that could arise from an immunisation programme of infants that may well eradicate RSV to a high degree and save the direct and indirect medical care costs from hospitalisation, morbidity and the gain from potential life-time earnings by reducing the probability of mortality. In this context, the majority of existing empirical investigations are based on data from clinical trials, and where relevant facts are not available, a series of strong assumptions is derived from the published literature, whereas in this study, for the first time, the hospital episode statistics database is used to calculate the cost-benefit ratios. The methodology of the analysis adopts a cost-benefit approach to assess the impact of the immunisation and whether it is beneficial to society. The underlying assumptions of the basic model are assessed by adopting a sensitivity analysis. The results show that a number of categories are cost-effective with the use of the passive drug, which means benefits by raising the life expectancy and quality as well as reducing the resource burden on society.

20,"A cost-benefit analysis of RSV prophylaxis in high-risk infants OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost and benefit of using RSV-IG and palivizumab as prophylactic therapy against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)- associated illness in high-risk infants. METHODS: A nonrandomized, retrospective, cohort control study was conducted comparing the outcomes of patients who received either RSV-IG or palivizumab therapy against RSV during the 1998-1999 RSV season with patients identified from the 1994-1995 RSV season who would have been eligible to receive prophylaxis had either agent been available at that time. Medical record reviews were conducted to gather data regarding the costs associated with both the administration of the prophylactic drugs and the treatment of RSV-associated hospitalizations in both groups. Decision analysis was used to determine the average cost per patient for both groups. A cost-benefit analysis was then conducted to determine the return on investment, if any, for the use of these drugs. A sensitivity analysis was also conducted to determine the robustness of the data. RESULTS: Patients who received RSV-IG or palivizumab had a hospitalization rate of 1.6% compared with 25% for the group who did not receive prophylactic drugs. The average costs for the RSV prophylaxis group were less per patient: $3733 compared with $4258 in the group who did not receive prophylaxis. The benefit is a 23.4% lower chance of hospitalization for each infant or, in dollar figures, $3985 ($17 031  0.234). The benefit-cost ratio is 1.15:1 ($3985:3461). The benefits, therefore, exceed the costs associated with the prophylaxis program. The prophylaxis program saved healthcare dollars by preventing RSV-related hospital-izations. CONCLUSIONS: Results demonstrate that when used according to our institution's criteria, RSV prophylaxis is of benefit to our institution.

21,"The Impact of Infection on Population Health: Results of the Ontario Burden of Infectious Diseases Study Background: Evidence-based priority setting is increasingly important for rationally distributing scarce health resources and for guiding future health research. We sought to quantify the contribution of a wide range of infectious diseases to the overall infectious disease burden in a high-income setting. Methodology/Principal Findings: We used health-adjusted life years (HALYs), a composite measure comprising premature mortality and reduced functioning due to disease, to estimate the burden of 51 infectious diseases and associated syndromes in Ontario using 2005-2007 data. Deaths were estimated from vital statistics data and disease incidence was estimated from reportable disease, healthcare utilization, and cancer registry data, supplemented by local modeling studies and national and international epidemiologic studies. The 51 infectious agents and associated syndromes accounted for 729 lost HALYs, 44.2 deaths, and 58,987 incident cases per 100,000 population annually. The most burdensome infectious agents were: hepatitis C virus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, human papillomavirus, hepatitis B virus, human immunodeficiency virus, Staphylococcus aureus, influenza virus, Clostridium difficile, and rhinovirus. The top five, ten, and 20 pathogens accounted for 46%, 67%, and 75% of the total infectious disease burden, respectively. Marked sex-specific differences in disease burden were observed for some pathogens. The main limitations of this study were the exclusion of certain infectious diseases due to data availability issues, not considering the impact of co-infections and co-morbidity, and the inability to assess the burden of milder infections that do not result in healthcare utilization. Conclusions/Significance: Infectious diseases continue to cause a substantial health burden in high-income settings such as Ontario. Most of this burden is attributable to a relatively small number of infectious agents, for which many effective interventions have been previously identified. Therefore, these findings should be used to guide public health policy, planning, and research.  2012 Kwong et al.

Study design: Analysis of data from 2415 preterm infants (32 to 35 weeks gestational age [GA]) hospitalized for proven or probable RSV and matched to 20,254 control infants. Results: Mean (SD) age at the index admission was 7.7 (5.5) months; 46% of the infants were male. Mean (SD) subsequent health services, excluding the index event, for the RSV cohort and control infants, respectively, were hospitalization, 2.96 (2.81) versus 1.28 (1.42); special care unit visits, 0.67 (1.70) versus 0.40 (0.33); respiratory therapy visits, 0:31 (0.70) versus 0.13 (0.37); physician consults, 3.61 (4.54) versus 0.89 (1.12); in-hospital procedures, 1.05 (4.02) versus 0.81 (1.51); outpatient visits, 18.4 (10.58) versus 7.54 (4.31); and mean (SD) inpatient days, 14.71 (18.69) versus 5.04 (7.09).

23,"Socioeconomic Impact of RSV Hospitalization Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease is a significant cause of morbidity and socioeconomic burden worldwide among young children. The majority of RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) and mortality occurs in developing countries and is associated with various sociodemographic risk factors. Independent risk factors for severe RSV disease include age and premature birth. While RSV mortality in developed countries is lower relative to developing countries, high-risk infants with comorbidities experience higher rates of mortality. RSV LRTI is often severe and is associated with hospitalization, increased need for intensive care unit admission and mechanical ventilation, long-term complications, and caregiver stress and loss of work productivity. Overall, these factors translate to higher health care resource utilization and costs and should be factored into the consideration for RSV prophylaxis. Multiple vaccine candidates and long-acting monoclonal antibodies are in various stages of clinical development. Currently, palivizumab is the only approved RSV immunoprophylaxis available for use in specific high-risk pediatric populations. This review will discuss the socioeconomic impact and health care resource utilization of RSV-related hospitalization (RSVH) as well as various sociodemographic risk factors that can be used to identify children at high risk of developing severe RSV disease.

25,"Cost of illness of rsv infection in a middle-income tropical country Background. Despite the burden of disease of Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in children, there are important gaps in knowledge about the potential impact in terms of health as well as social and healthcare resources. The aim of this study was to describe the economic burden of RSV in the first two years of life in Colombia. Methods. We conducted a cost-of-illness study, taking a population prevalence-based approach. A decision tree model was constructed with a time horizon of two years. We defined the following outcomes: death, RSV infection with long term complications, RSV with acute complications, RSV without complications. Inpatient and outpatient costs were collected directly from medical invoices of patients who attended a tertiary referral hospital. Results. The mean cost per patient with an RSV infection was US$ 178.35 CI 95% (30.7-541.67 US$). The total cost of RSV infection in children less than 2 years in Colombia was US $ 64 443 616 per year (CI 95% US$11 092 902  US$195 722 867). In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the mean cost per patient with RSV infection was only sensitive to changes in the cost of recurrent wheezing, cost of outpatient visits and cost of hospitalizations. Conclusion. The infection by RSV in Colombia generates a high economic burden on the health system. Generating comprehensive data on healthcare resource use and costs associated with RSV will help to provide valuable information for the development of cost-effectiveness models, and help guide prevention strategies against RSV.

26,"A strategy for the management of hospitalized children with acute lower respiratory infections Objectives To improve the quality of care provided to hospitalized children having acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI), to increase the knowledge on this health condition, and to broaden the utilization of health care resources through a program called ""Winter Plan"". Methods The program comprised the use of guidelines for diagnosis and treatment, disease-oriented hospitalizations to provide an increased level of care, management of health care resources and implementation of computerized medical records. Systematic investigation of viral etiology was performed in order to rationalize the use of medications and reduce nosocomial infections. Results During program implementation (19/V-19/IX/99), 3,317 children were admitted; 1,347 (40.61%) had ALRI, of which 1,096 (81%) were included in the study. Of them, 71% aged less than 1 year. Most ALRI were viral (68%). Admission criteria were: oxygen saturation <95%, tachypnea, retractions or pleural effusion (92.4% of the children). The demand magnitude prevented compliance with isolation guidelines in all cases. Treatment guidelines were followed in a high percentage of cases: 73% of children having bronchiolitis and 72% of those with viral pneumonia received no antibiotics and 96% of children with bacterial pneumonia were put on antibiotics as recommended; use of bronchodilators and corticosteroids was reduced. Medication costs were reduced especially in the corticosteroid group, which meant a greater impact on hospitalization costs. Conclusions To decrease ALRI morbidity and mortality there is a need to continue improving the quality of health care during hospitalization and to reinforce health promotion actions and preventive programs at the primary level.

27,"Economic and Clinical Outcomes of Pediatric Patients Under Two With Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection in Thailand: A Real-world Retrospective Cohort Study Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common cause of acute respiratory tract infection in children, including in Thailand. We conducted this study to evaluate the economic and clinical outcomes of patients <2 years old with RSV infection at a tertiary teaching hospital in Thailand. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study during 2014-2021. To be eligible, patients had to report at least 1 positive RSV test and were <2 years old. Descriptive statistics were used to describe baseline characteristics, healthcare resource utilization, direct medical costs (1 US dollars [USD] = 31.98 Thai Baht) and clinical outcomes. Results: Among 1370 RSV-positive patients, 49.9% of the patients (n = 683) were hospitalized at or within 3 days of RSV diagnosis with a median length of stay of 6 days (interquartile range [IQR]: 4-9 days), 38.8% were diagnosed with RSV-related respiratory complications (n = 532) and 1.5% died during the hospitalization episode (n = 20). A total of 22.5% of hospitalized patients (n = 154) received critical care during the hospitalization episode. The median cost of each RSV episode was USD539 (IQR: USD167-USD2106) and was higher among hospitalized patients (median: USD2112; IQR: USD1379-USD3182) compared with nonhospitalized patients (median: USD167; IQR: USD112-USD276). Conclusions: RSV infection represents a potentially important contributor to healthcare resource use and medical costs among children <2 years old in Thailand.

29,"Resource utilization for noncardiac admissions in pediatric patients with single ventricle disease Patients with single ventricle (SV) congenital heart disease (CHD) incur high hospital costs during staged surgical palliation. Health care resource utilization for noncardiac admissions in patients with SV has not been reported. This study sought to compare costs and outcomes for common noncardiac hospital admissions between patients with SV and patients without CHD. Hospital discharge data from the University Health System Consortium from January 2011 to December 2013 was queried for patients aged 18 years with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes for SV lesions: hypoplastic left heart syndrome (746.7), tricuspid atresia (746.1), or common ventricle (745.3). Primary diagnosis, direct cost, length of stay (LOS), intensive care unit admission rate and mortality data were obtained. The 10 most common noncardiac admission diagnoses were compared between patients with SV and patients without CHD using t test and Fisher's exact test. Total direct cost, LOS, and intensive care unit admission rate were higher for patients with SV for all diagnoses with the exception of LOS for dehydration, which was not different between groups. Hospital mortality was significantly higher for patients with SV admitted for acute kidney injury, esophageal reflux, failure to thrive, respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis and pneumonia. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that patients with SV CHD admitted with noncardiac diagnoses have higher health care resource utilization compared to those without CHD. As long-term survival increases, it can be expected that this patient group will use a disproportionate amount of medical dollars.

30,"Long-term burden and respiratory effects of respiratory syncytial virus hospitalization in preterm infants-The SPRING study The health status of premature infants born 32(1)-35(0) weeks' gestational age (wGA) hospitalized for RSV infection in the first year of life (cases; n = 125) was compared to that of premature infants not hospitalized for RSV (controls; n = 362) through 6 years. The primary endpoints were the percentage of children with wheezing between 2-6 years and lung function at 6 years of age. Secondary endpoints included quality of life, healthcare resource use, and allergic sensitization. A significantly higher proportion of cases than controls experienced recurrent wheezing through 6 years of age (46.7% vs. 27.4%; p = 0.001). The vast majority of lung function tests appeared normal at 6 years of age in both cohorts. In children with pulmonary function in the lower limit of normality (FEV(1) Z-score [-2; -1]), wheezing was increased, particularly for cases vs. controls (72.7% vs. 18.9%, p = 0.002). Multivariate analysis revealed the most important factor for wheezing was RSV hospitalization. Quality of life on the respiratory subscale of the TAPQOL was significantly lower (p = 0.001) and healthcare resource utilization was significantly higher (p<0.001) in cases than controls. This study confirms RSV disease is associated with wheezing in 32-35 wGA infants through 6 years of age.

31,"Why has the epidemiology of RSV changed during the COVID-19 pandemic? The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has drastically perturbed the epidemiology of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) respiratory tract infections in children. The reasons for this are not clear. In this article, we review the current literature and critically discuss the different theories to explain why the epidemiology of RSV has changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Proposed mechanisms include decreased viral immunity in vulnerable age groups caused by the prolonged lack of RSV circulation early in the pandemic, potential Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced immune dysregulation, viral interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, and modifications in health-seeking behaviors as well as heath systems factors. Research in viral genomics and phylogeny, and more robust immunology research is needed to guide RSV prevention and health care resource planning.

32,"Epidemiology and prevention of respiratory syncytial virus infections among infants and young children Since its discovery in 1956, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has been recognized as one of the most common causes of serious lower respiratory tract infections in young children worldwide. While considered a high priority, development of a safe and effective vaccine has remained elusive. Prevention of RSV disease relies on infection control and hygiene measures, as well as providing immunoprophylaxis in select infants. The prophylaxis, however, is costly, and so targeting the recipient population and timing of administration is important for optimal effectiveness and judicious use of limited health care resources. This article reviews the epidemiology of RSV infections in infants and young children, including risk factors for severe disease, so as to inform decisions about prevention efforts.

33,"Clinical Practice Patterns and Risk Factors for Severe Conditions in Pediatric Hospitalizations With Respiratory Syncytial Virus in Japan: A Nationwide Analyses (2018-2022) BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) represents a global health challenge, especially among younger children. While the disease burden in Japan has been preliminarily quantified, there remains a lack of comprehensive understanding regarding treatment patterns and the influence of known risk factors at a national scale. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study consisting of 50,482 children under 5 years hospitalized with RSV infections during 2018-2022 using the Medical Data Vision database. We investigated trends in patient characteristics, health resource use, treatment patterns, and laboratory data. Additionally, multivariable modified Poisson regression models were used to investigate the risk factors associated with severe conditions. RESULTS: We observed an increasing trend in the inpatient healthcare costs and decreasing trends in the use of antibiotics, bronchodilators, systemic corticosteroids and other symptomatic medications from 2018 to 2022. Risk factors associated with severe RSV infections were children aged 0 years (risk ratio, 2.90; 95% CI: 2.53-3.32) and the number of complex chronic diseases (risk ratio for 1 disease, 2.68; 95% CI: 2.34-3.06: risk ratio for 2 or more diseases, 6.91; 95% CI: 5.81-8.21). Annual inpatient healthcare costs for RSV infections were estimated at 11-14 billion Japanese Yen for younger children. CONCLUSIONS: Our study observed the changes in practice patterns and health resource use for children hospitalized with RSV infections and identified risk factors associated with severe conditions. These findings provide insights for policymakers and clinicians aiming to devise strategies for further improving clinical practices, including newly developed vaccines and single-dose long-acting monoclonal antibodies.

34,"Common cold The common cold is the most frequent human disease, time-consuming for pediatrician, and challenging to public health-care resources. Pediatrician must advice about self-care and avoiding unnecessary medical treatment. Rhinovirus are the most frequent etiologic agents. A typical child have 4-8 episodes/year in the first ten years, more in the first 3 in child care attendance. Diversity of serotypes doesn't allow development of absolute inmunity. Clinical symptomatology is produced by inflammatory mediators secreted in response to viral toxicity over epithelial cells. Virus is transmitted by infectious nasal secretions. Only frequent hand washing is useful in prevention. Clinical manifestations are more intense in infants and toddlers and are 4-10 days long. Treatment must be based in counseling, home care, and unusually in pharmacology symptomatic treatment, as antipyretic-analgesics. Antimicrobials must be used only in infrequent cases where a bacterial superinfection is strongly suspected on clinical bases. (De La Flor I Bru J.)

35,"Expert recommendations for the prevention and control of pediatric respiratory syncytial virus infections in China (2023 edition) Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the major pathogens responsible for acute lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) and hospitalizations in children. It is also the primary viral pathogen causing lower respiratory tract infections in children under 5 years old, posing a significant threat to child health. In order to advance RSV prevention and control efforts and comprehensively explore RSV disease burden, epidemiological patterns, development and regulation of preventive and therapeutic measures, as well as the formulation of related strategies for prevention and control, the Editorial Board of the Chinese Medical Association Chinese Medical Journal convened the ""Chinese Respiratory Syncytial Virus Forum"" in December 2022. Participating experts, focusing on the current research status and developmental requirements concerning respiratory syncytial virus, engaged in discussions and exchanges, culminating in the formulation of expert recommendations for the prevention and control of pediatric respiratory syncytial virus infections in China: (1) Strengthen research on RSV epidemiological characteristics and disease burden; (2) Establish a collaborative, multidepartmental, and multidisciplinary approach for sustained, multicenter, longterm monitoring; (3) Emphasize innovation, research, development, and implementation of vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, and diagnostic methods; (4) Propel the formulation and implementation of RSV immunoprophylaxis strategies; (5) Coordinate and allocate pediatric medical and health resources rationally to prevent nosocomial infections.

36,"School age outcome of hospitalisation with respiratory syncytial virus infection of prematurely born infants Background: Hospitalisation due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in the first 2 years after birth has been associated with increased healthcare utilisation and associated costs up to 5 years of age in children born prematurely at less than 32 weeks of gestation who developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). A study was undertaken to determine whether hospitalisation due to RSV infection in the first 2 years was associated with increased morbidity and lung function abnormalities in such children at school age, and if any effects were influenced by age. Methods: Healthcare utilisation and cost of care in years 5-7 were reviewed in 147 children and changes in healthcare utilisation between 0 and 8 years were assessed also using results from two previous studies. At age 8-10 years, 77 children had their lung function assessed and bronchial hyper-responsiveness determined. Results: Children hospitalised with RSV infection (n = 25) in the first 2 years had a greater cost of care related to outpatient attendance than those with a nonrespiratory or no admission (n = 72) when aged 5-7 years (p = 0.008). At 8-10 years of age, children hospitalised with RSV infection (n = 14) had lower forced expiratory volume in 0.75 s (FEV(0.75)) (p = 0.015), FEV (0.75)/forced vital capacity (p = 0.027) and flows at 50% (p = 0.034) and 75% (p = 0.006) of vital capacity than children hospitalised for non-RSV causes (n = 63). Healthcare utilisation decreased with increasing age regardless of RSV hospitalisation status. Conclusions: In prematurely born children who had BPD, hospitalisation due to RSV infection in the first 2 years is associated with reduced airway calibre at school age.

37,"Relative impact of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus in young children OBJECTIVE: We measured the relative impact of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections in young children in terms of emergency department (ED) visits, clinical care requirements, and overall resource use. METHODS: Patients who were aged 7 years and treated in the ED of a tertiary care pediatric hospital for an acute respiratory infection were enrolled during 2 winter seasons between 2003 and 2005. We quantified health care resource use for children with influenza or RSV infections, and extrapolated results to estimate the national resource use associated with influenza and RSV infections. RESULTS: Nationally, an estimated 10.2 ED visits per 1000 children were attributable to influenza and 21.5 visits per 1000 to RSV. Children who were aged 0 to 23 months and infected with RSV had the highest rate of ED visits with 64.4 visits per 1000 children. Significantly more children required hospitalization as a result of an RSV infection compared with influenza, with national hospitalization rates of 8.5 and 1.4 per 1000 children, respectively. The total number of workdays missed yearly by caregivers of children who required ED care was 246 965 days for influenza infections and 716 404 days for RSV infections. CONCLUSION: For young children, RSV is associated with higher rates of ED visits, hospitalization, and caregiver resource use than is influenza. Our results provide data on the large number of children who receive outpatient care for influenza and RSV illnesses and serve to inform analyses of prevention programs and treatments for both influenza and RSV disease.

38,"Clinical and pharmacological aspects of immunoprophylaxis for respiratory syncytial virus infection in high-risk infants Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of respiratory tract infection in infants and young children throughout the world. Although preterm birth has been considered for years the major risk factor for severe disease and hospitalization, recent findings indicate that prematurity is not a necessary condition, but one of the independent risk factors for severe RSV infection, together with chronic lung diseases, congenital heart disease and immunodeficiency. Furthermore, over 50% of infants hospitalized for RSV infections during the first year of life are healthy, full-term newborns, suggesting that other environmental and individual factors may be involved. Unfortunately, there is still no specific therapy against RSV infection and therefore prophylactic measures seem to be the only intervention to avoid disease complications. No safe and effective RSV vaccine is available for the prevention of serious RSV infection. Therefore, in addition to hygienic measures, the only approach is passive immunoprophylaxis with humanized monoclonal anti-RSV antibodies, such as palivizumab that have been developed for clinical use. Because of the high cost of these antibodies, a better definition of the individual risk profile for severe RSV infection and timing of administration is needed for optimal effectiveness and careful use of limited health care resources. In this article, we have reviewed the clinical and pharmacological aspects of immunoprophylaxis with monoclonal antibodies for preventing RSV infection in high-risk infants.  2013 Bentham Science Publishers.

We conducted population-based surveillance in 3 hospitals (2009-2012) and 3 outpatient clinics (2011-2012) in Damanhour district. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimens from hospitalized patients with acute respiratory illness and outpatients with influenza-like illness were tested by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for RSV. We also conducted a healthcare utilization survey in 2011-2012 to determine the proportion of individuals who sought care for respiratory illness. Results. Among 5342 hospitalized patients and 771 outpatients, 12% and 5% tested positive for RSV, respectively. The incidence of RSV-associated hospitalization and outpatient visits was estimated at 24 and 608 (per 100 000 person-years), respectively. Children aged <1 year experienced the highest incidence of RSV-associated hospitalizations (1745/100 000 person-years). onclusions.

40,"Systematic review and meta-analysis of respiratory syncytial virus infection epidemiology in Latin America SUMMARY: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a frequent cause of acute respiratory infection and the most common cause of bronchiolitis in infants. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to obtain a comprehensive epidemiological picture of the data available on disease burden, surveillance, and use of resources in Latin America. Pooled estimates are useful for cross-country comparisons. Data from published studies reporting patients with probable or confirmed RSV infection in medical databases and gray literature were included from 74 studies selected from the 291 initially identified. When considering all countries, the largest pooled percentage RSV in low respiratory tract infection patients was found in the group between 0 and 11months old, 41.5% (95% CI 32.0-51.4). In all countries, percentages were increasingly lower as older children were included in the analyses. The pooled percentage of RSV in LRTIs in the elderly people was 12.6 (95% CI 4.2-24.6). The percentage of RSV infection in hospitalized newborns was 40.9% (95% CI 28.28-54.34). The pooled case fatality ratio for RSV infection was 1.74% (95% CI 1.2-2.4) in the first 2years of life. The average length of stay excluding intensive care unit admissions among children with risk factors for severe disease was 12.8 (95% CI 8.9-16.7) days, whereas it averaged 7.3 (95% CI 6.1/8.5) days in otherwise healthy children. We could conclude that infants in their first year of age were the most vulnerable population.

41,"Excess drug prescriptions during influenza and RSV seasons in the Netherlands: Potential implications for extended influenza vaccination Influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections are responsible for considerable morbidity, mortality and health-care resource use. For the Netherlands, we estimated age and risk-group specific numbers of antibiotics, otologicals and cardiovascular prescriptions per 10,000 person-years during periods with elevated activity of influenza or RSV, and compared these with peri-season rates. Data were taken from the University of Groningen in-house prescription database (www.iadb.nl) and virological surveillance for the period 1998-2006. During influenza and RSV periods excess antibiotic prescriptions were estimated for all age groups. In the age groups 0-1 and 2-4 years, excess antibiotic prescriptions during periods with elevated RSV activity (65% and 59% of peri-seasonal rates) exceeded the surpluses estimated during the influenza-activity periods (24% and 34% of peri-seasonal rates) while for otologicals excess prescriptions were higher for influenza (22% and 27%) than for RSV (14% and 17%). Among persons of 50 years and older, notably those without medical high-risk conditions, excess prescriptions for cardiovascular medications were estimated during the influenza periods at approximately 10% (this was also already seen in persons aged 45-49). Our results may have implications for influenza vaccination policies. In particular, extension of influenza vaccination to groups of non-elderly adults and young children may lower excess prescriptions during these influenza periods for all three types of drug prescriptions investigated.  2008 Elsevier Ltd.

42,"Bronchiolitis in Inuit children from a Canadian central arctic community, 1995-1996. During the winter and summer of 1996 two outbreaks of bronchiolitis occurred among Inuit children in the Canadian arctic community of Arviat. The epidemiology and clinical features of these epidemics were studied through a chart review of bronchiolitis cases occurring from September 1, 1995 to August 31, 1996. The attack rate over the year was 57% and the incidence was 1.25 cases per child-year at risk. The median age of cases was 9 months. Children developing bronchiolitis were more likely to be male (p = 0.006). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was isolated from 17 cases occurring in January/February. The hospitalization rate during those two months was 38%, mortality was 3.3%, and demands upon local health care resources were high. Parainfluenza virus type 3 was isolated from 8 cases occurring during a second smaller outbreak in July/August. Hospitalized children were more likely to be bottle-fed (p = 0.01), and duration of hospitalization was greater for RSV positive versus negative children (p = 0.002). Among those hospitalized 22% required a second admission for the same illness.

43,"Short-term relevance of lower respiratory viral coinfection in inpatients under 2 years of age Introduction: Advances in molecular diagnosis have made it possible to detect previously unknown viral agents as causative agents of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI). The frequency and relevance of viral coinfections is still debatable. Objective: compare clinical presentation and severity between single virus infection and viral coinfection in children admitted for LRTI. Methods: A 3-year period observational study (2012-2015) included children younger than two years admitted for LRTI. Viral identification was performed using PCR technique for 16 viruses. Clinical data and use of health resources was gathered during hospital stay using a standard collection form and we compared single virus infection and viral coinfections. Results: The study included 524 samples (451 patients); 448 (85,5%) had at least one virus identified. Viral coinfections were found in 159 (35,5%). RSV and HRV were the most commonly identified virus; bronchiolitis and pneumonia the most frequent diagnosis. Patients with viral coinfections were older, attended day-care centers, had previous recurrent wheezing more frequently and were more symptomatic at admission. These patients did not have more complementary exams performed but were prescribed medications more often. Viral coinfection group did not show longer length of hospital stay and oxygen need, more need for ICU nor ventilatory support. Discussion: Our study showed a significant proportion of viral coinfections in young infants admitted with LRTI and confirmed previous data showing that prescription was more frequent in inpatients with viral coinfections, without an association with worst clinical outcome.

44,"Respiratory-related hospitalizations following prophylaxis in the canadian registry for palivizumab (2005-2012) compared to other international registries Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection occurs commonly in infants aged 2 years, and severe infection results in hospitalization with accompanying morbidity and mortality. Palivizumab has been available for prophylaxis for the past 15 years. Prospective data on patients who received palivizumab from 2005 to 2012 has been assembled in the Canadian registry (CARESS) to document utilization, compliance, and health outcomes in both hospital and community settings. Long-term data is necessary to evaluate the impact of palivizumab on the incidence of RSV infections, minimize healthcare resources, and identify which infant subpopulations are receiving prophylaxis. A database search was also conducted for similar information from published registries, and hospitalization rates were compared to results from randomized clinical trials (RCTs).Overall hospitalization rates (percent; range) for respiratory-related illnesses and RSV-specific infection in infants who meet standard indications for prophylaxis were 6.6 (3.3-7.7) and 1.55 (0.3-2.06), respectively, in CARESS, which closely aligns with registry data from 4 other countries, despite the former comprising the largest cohort of complex patients internationally.

45,"Health care costs of hospitalization of young children for respiratory syncytial virus infections: a population-based matched cohort study BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection poses a substantial clinical burden among infants and young children. We sought to determine the health care costs of hospitalizations attributable to RSV in Ontario, Canada, from the health care payer perspective. METHODS: For this population-based matched cohort study, we identified children younger than 24 months who were or were not hospitalized with RSV infections in 2006-2016. We performed a cost-of-illness analysis using linked administrative health data, with subjects stratified by gestational age and congenital heart disease, and propensity score-matched on established risk factors. The primary outcome was attributable health care costs per patient, reflecting the difference in direct medical costs between the groups, calculated to 12 months postdischarge in 2020 Canadian dollars. RESULTS: We identified 14 608 RSV-infected children, matched to 72 040 controls. The adjusted attributable cost of hospitalized RSV was $134 931 900 over 10 years, or $9240 per patient (95% confidence interval [CI] $8790-$9690). Health care costs escalated 3 days before hospitalization, and persisted up to 12 months after discharge. Increased costs were associated with major comorbidities, but not extreme premature birth. The highest mean attributable cost per patient was in the presence of hemodynamically significant heart disease ($60 110, 95% CI $26 700-$93 060). Infants born at 36-43 weeks' gestation constituted the greatest overall cost burden at $117 886 720. INTERPRETATION: Although the greatest direct medical costs per patient hospitalized with RSV infection are among children with cardiac disease, the greatest overall cost burden is from children born at or near term, who are not targeted by current prophylaxis strategies. The substantial attributable health care costs of RSV can inform cost-effectiveness analyses of novel RSV vaccines and prioritization of health care resources.

Methods: Based on a prospective case series study in Henan Province in 20202021, inpatients aged 059 months with RSV-related acute respiratory infections (ARIs) were included into analysis. Total cost included direct medical cost (sum of medical cost before and during hospitalization), direct non-medical cost, and indirect cost. Direct medical cost during hospitalization data were extracted from the hospital information system. Other costs and HRQoL status were obtained from a telephone survey conducted in the caregivers of the enrolled patients. Results: Among 261 RSV-infected inpatients, caregivers of 170 non-severe cases (65.1%, 170/261) were successfully interviewed. Direct medical cost per episode was 1055.3 US dollars (US$) (95% CI: 998.21112.5 US$). Direct non-medical cost and indirect cost per episode were 83.6 US$ (95% CI: 77.589.7 US$) and 162.4 US$ (95% CI: 127.9197.0 US$), respectively. Quality adjusted life years (QALY) loss for non-severe RSV hospitalization was 8.9  10(3) (95% CI: 7.9  10(3)9.9  10(3)). The majority of inpatients were <1 year of age comprising significantly higher cost and more QALY loss than older children. Conclusions: RSV-associated hospitalization poses high economic and health burden in Central China particularly for children <1 year old. Our findings are crucial for determining the priority of interventions and allocation of health resources.

47,"Respiratory outcomes, utilization and costs 12 months following a respiratory syncytial virus diagnosis among commercially insured late-preterm infants Objectives: To determine, among a commercially-insured population of late-preterm infants, utilization of healthcare resources and costs during the 1 year following a diagnosis of respiratory syncytial virus lower respiratory infection (RSV LRI). Methods: Administrative claims for non-capitated, commercially-insured infants <1 year old were used to identify infants diagnosed with RSV LRI and unspecified bronchiolitis/pneumonia (UBP). Infants were stratified by the setting of diagnosis. Infants without evidence of RSV LRI or UBP were selected as a comparison group. Economic and clinical outcomes were analyzed descriptively using propensity score weighting and logged ordinary least squares models were used to examine the relationship between RSV and costs (adjusted to 2006 USD) incurred within 1 year of RSV LRI. Results: The majority of infants were 3 months or older at the time of RSV LRI or UBP diagnosis. The rate of wheezing was significantly greater for infants in the RSV LRI and UBP cohorts relative to the comparison group (p<0.001). Infantile asthma rates were 69 times higher among RSV LRI and UBP infants than the comparison group. RSV LRI and UBP infants also had significantly more emergency department visits and outpatient visits than the comparison group. The marginal healthcare costs were significantly higher for RSV LRI inpatients ($24027) and outpatients ($2703) infants than for the comparison group (all p<0.001). Conclusion: Commercially insured late-preterm infants with RSV infection are at high risk for recurrent wheezing and infantile asthma during the 1-year period after the initial episode and impose a significant economic burden to the healthcare system.  2011 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved.

48,"Increased Risk of Hospitalization for Pneumonia in Italian Adults from 2010 to 2019: Scientific Evidence for a Call to Action Background: Understanding trends in pneumonia-associated hospitalizations can help to quantify the burden of disease and identify risk conditions and at-risk populations. This study evaluated characteristics of hospitalizations due to pneumonia that occurred in Italy in a 10-year period from 2010 to 2019. Methods: All hospitalizations with a principal or secondary diagnosis of pneumonia over the 10-year period were included, which were identified by hospital discharges for all-cause pneumonia and pneumococcal pneumonia in the anonymized hospital discharge database of the Italian Health Ministry. Results: A total of 2,481,213 patients were hospitalized for pneumonia between 2010 and 2019; patients aged 7586 years accounted for 30.1% of hospitalizations. Most hospitalizations (88.1%) had an unspecified pneumonia discharge code. In-hospital death was recorded in 13.0% of cases. The cumulative cost for pneumonia hospitalizations of the 10-year period were EUR 11,303,461,591. Over the observation period, the incidence rate for hospitalized all-cause pneumonia in any ages increased from 100 per 100,000 in 2010 to over 160 cases per 100,000 per year in 2019 (p < 0.001). Overall, there was a significant increase in annual percent changes in hospitalization rates (+3.47 per year), in-hospital death (+4.6% per year), and costs (+3.95% per year) over the 10-year period. Conclusions: Our analysis suggests that hospitalizations for pneumonia are increasing over time in almost all age groups, especially in the elderly. Given the substantial burden of pneumonia in terms of mortality, healthcare resources, and economic costs, greater public health efforts should thus be made to promote vaccinations against influenza and pneumococcus, particularly in high-risk groups.

49,"Economic impact of respiratory syncytial virus-related illness in the US: An analysis of national databases Objective: To determine the impact of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection on healthcare resource use and costs in the US from the third-party payer perspective. Design: The study retrospectively analysed cross-sectional medical encounter data from three federally funded databases that comprise nationally representative samples of hospital inpatient stays, physician office visits and visits to hospital outpatient departments and emergency rooms. Methods: Identification of RSV infection-related medical encounters was based on the occurrence of RSV-specific International Classification of Diseases (9th Edition)-Clinical Modification diagnosis codes (079.6, 466.11, 480.1) as principal discharge diagnoses or the assumption that 10-15% of all otitis media visits were due to RSV infection. Outpatient drug costs were estimated based on average wholesale price, and physician fees and test/procedure costs were estimated based on prevailing national fees. Inpatient costs were estimated from total billed charges using a cost-to-charge ratio of 0.53. Results: In 2000, nearly 98% of RSV infection-related hospitalisations occurred in children <5 years old. There were approximately 86 000 hospitalisations, 1.7 million office visits, 402 000 emergency room visits and 236 000 hospital outpatient visits for children <5 years old that were attributable to RSV infection. Total annual direct medical costs for all RSV infection-related hospitalisations ($US394 million) and other medical encounters ($US258 million) for children <5 years old were estimated at $US652 million in 2000. Otitis media was a major cost driver for physician visits. RSV infection-related hospitalisations increased from 1993 to 2000, but average costs per hospitalisation were relatively stable. Conclusion: Treatment of RSV infection-related illness represents a significant healthcare burden in the US. The economic impact of ambulatory care for RSV infection-related illness could be as important as that for RSV infection-related hospitalisation. (Paramore L.C., paramore@medtap.com; Ciesla G.)

50,"Human metapneumovirus infection is associated with severe respiratory disease in preschool children with history of prematurity Background Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a recently discovered respiratory pathogen of the family Paramyxoviridae, the same family as that of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Premature children are at high risk of severe RSV infections, however, it is unclear whether HMPV infection is more severe in hospitalized children with a history of severe prematurity. Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of the clinical respiratory presentation of all polymerase chain reaction-confirmed HMPV infections in preschool-age children (5 years) with and without history of severe prematurity (<32 weeks gestation). Respiratory distress scores were developed to examine the clinical severity of HMPV infections. Demographic and clinical variables were obtained from reviewing electronic medical records. Results A total of 571 preschool children were identified using polymerase chain reaction-confirmed viral respiratory tract infection during the study period. HMPV was identified as a causative organism in 63 cases (11%). Fifty-eight (n = 58) preschool-age children with HMPV infection were included in this study after excluding those with significant comorbidities. Our data demonstrated that 32.7% of children admitted with HMPV had a history of severe prematurity. Preschool children with a history of prematurity had more severe HMPV disease as illustrated by longer hospitalizations, new or increased need for supplemental O(2), and higher severity scores independently of age, ethnicity, and history of asthma. Conclusion Our study suggests that HMPV infection causes significant disease burden among preschool children with a history of prematurity leading to severe respiratory infections and increasing health care resource utilization due to prolonged hospitalizations.

51,"A population study of respiratory rehospitalisation in very preterm infants in the first 3 years of life Aim: Very premature infants consume healthcare resources following discharge from neonatal intensive care units (NICU). This study aimed to evaluate the burden of respiratory related rehospitalisation within the first 3 years post discharge in very premature infants in an Australian population. Methods: Rehospitalisation of a 4-year cohort of NICU survivors, born less than 32 weeks gestation, was derived from data linkage of three state-wide databases including NSW Neonatal Intensive Care Units' Data Collection, Admitted Patient Data Collection and the Death Registry. Rehospitalisation diagnoses were determined by ICD-10 AM codes. Results: Of the 2939 survivors, 525 (18%) had bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and 261 BPD infants (50%) were discharged on home oxygen. Almost two-third (1860, 63%) of the survivors are required rehospitalisation, respiratory causes, including 394 respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-related, accounted for 2668 (48%) of the 5599 rehospitalisations. Significantly more home oxygen BPD survivors had respiratory (70%) and RSV-related (22%) rehospitalisations than the BPD infants not needing home oxygen (58% and 18%, respectively), and the survivors without BPD had the lowest rates (32% and 10%, P < 0.001). Most respiratory (61%) and RSV-related (74%) rehospitalisations occurred during the first 12 months post discharge. No RSV-related fatality occurred. Amongst the total 17 562 hospital days, respiratory and RSV-related admissions accounted for 10 905 (62%) and 3031 (17.2%) days. In multivariable logistic analyses, home oxygen and maternal indigenous status were independently associated with high (3 or more) respiratory and RSV rehospitalisation rates. Conclusions: Respiratory rehospitalisations are common in very premature survivors. Home oxygen and indigenous status are significant risk factors for respiratory and RSV-related rehospitalisations.

52,"Severe illnesses associated with outbreaks of respiratory syncytial virus and influenza in adults Background. Recent reports have described the contribution of adult respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections to the use of advanced healthcare resources and death. Methods. Data regarding patients aged 18 years admitted to any of Maryland's 50 acute-care hospitals were evaluated over 12 consecutive years (2001-2013). We examined RSV and influenza (flu) surveillance data from the US National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and used this information to define RSV and flu outbreak periods in the Maryland area. Outbreak periods consisted of consecutive individual weeks during which at least 10% of RSV and/or flu diagnostic tests were positive. We examined relationships of RSV and flu outbreaks to occurrence of 4 advanced medical outcomes (hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, intubated mechanical ventilation, and death) due to medically attended acute respiratory illness (MAARI). Results. Occurrences of all 4 MAARI-related hospital advanced medical outcomes were consistently greater for all adult ages during RSV, flu, and combined RSV-flu outbreak periods compared to nonoutbreak periods and tended to be greatest in adults aged 65 years during combined RSV-flu outbreak periods. Rate ratios for all 4 MAARI-related advanced medical outcomes ranged from 1.04 to 1.38 during the RSV, flu, or combined RSV-flu outbreaks compared to the nonoutbreak periods, with all 95% lower confidence limits >1. Conclusions. Both RSV and flu outbreaks were associated with surges in MAARI-related advanced medical outcomes (hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, intubated mechanical ventilation, and death) for adults of all ages.

53,"Prophylaxis protects infants with congenital heart disease from severe forms of RSV infection: an Italian observational retrospective study: Palivizumab prophylaxis in children with congenital heart disease Background: In children with congenital heart disease (CHD) respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection may have a severe course, with increased risk of morbidity and mortality, requiring hospital admission and intensive care. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of prophylaxis with palivizumab in preventing RSV-associated hospitalization in infants with CHD. Methods: We carried out an observational, retrospective study in a paediatric cardiology division at a secondary-care centre in Italy, extracting from the database children with CHD who, from November 2004 to March 2022, matched the criteria for palivizumab prophylaxis, to evaluate the hospitalization rate in CHD patients with and without palivizumab prophylaxis and their RSV-related hospitalization characteristics compared with a group of children without CHD and no other underlying clinical conditions (control group, CG), hospitalized for RSV infection. Results: One hundred twenty-eight children with CHD were enrolled in the study, mainly (71.9%) with increased pulmonary flow, and received palivizumab prophylaxis. Twenty-seven received hospital care for bronchiolitis. Almost all CHD patients hospitalized for bronchiolitis (26 out of 27) received partial prophylaxis ( 3 doses). CHD patients with bronchiolitis stay longer in the hospital than control (14.4  21.7 days vs 6.2  2.3 days) some of which require intensive care (n = 4). Conclusions: Our study provides evidence of the efficacy of palivizumab in protecting patients with hemodynamically significant CHD under the age of 2 years from RSV disease and its life-threatening complications. Reducing hospitalisation rate, morbidity, and mortality in this category of patients, passive immune prophylaxis with palivizumab may impact healthcare resource availability and utilisation.

55,"Healthcare-Associated Respiratory Syncytial Virus in Childrens Hospitals Background: Outbreaks of healthcare-associated respiratory syncytial virus (HA-RSV) infections in children are well described, but less is known about sporadic HA-RSV infections. We assessed the epidemiology and clinical outcomes associated with sporadic HA-RSV infections. Methods: We retrospectively identified hospitalized children 18 years old with HA-RSV infections in six childrens hospitals in the United States during the respiratory viral seasons OctoberApril in 20162017, 20172018, and 20182019 and prospectively from October 2020 through November 2021. We evaluated outcomes temporally associated with HA-RSV infections including escalation of respiratory support, transfer to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), and in-hospital mortality. We assessed demographic characteristics and comorbid conditions associated with escalation of respiratory support. Results: We identified 122 children (median age 16.0 months [IQR 6, 60 months]) with HA-RSV. The median onset of HA-RSV infections was hospital day 14 (IQR 7, 34 days). Overall, 78 (63.9%) children had two or more comorbid conditions; cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, neurologic/neuromuscular, respiratory, and premature/ neonatal comorbidities were most common. Fifty-five (45.1%) children required escalation of respiratory support and 18 (14.8%) were transferred to the PICU. Five (4.1%) died during hospitalization. In the multivariable analysis, respiratory comorbidities (aOR: 3.36 [CI(95) 1.41, 8.01]) were associated with increased odds of escalation of respiratory support. Conclusions: HA-RSV infections cause preventable morbidity and increase healthcare resource utilization. Further study of effective mitigation strategies for HA-respiratory viral infections should be prioritized; this priority is further supported by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on seasonal viral infections. We identified 122 children with healthcare-associated (HA) respiratory syncytial virus infections; 55 (45%) required escalation of respiratory support and 18 (15%) were transferred to the Pediatric ICU.

56,"SENTINEL1: An Observational Study of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Hospitalizations among US. Infants Born at 29 to 35 Weeks' Gestational Age Not Receiving Immunoprophylaxis Objective SENTINEL1 characterized U.S. preterm infants 29 to 35 weeks' gestational age (wGA) < 12 months old hospitalized for laboratory-confirmed respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease and not receiving RSV immunoprophylaxis during the 2014 to 2015 RSV season. Study Design This is a noninterventional, observational, cohort study. Results A total of 702 infants were hospitalized with community-acquired RSV disease, of whom an estimated 42% were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and 20% required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). Earlier gestational age and younger chronologic age were associated with an increased frequency of RSV-confirmed hospitalization (RSVH), ICU admission, and IMV. Among infants 29 to 32 wGA and < 3 months of age, 68% required ICU admission and 44% required IMV. One death occurred of an infant 29 wGA. Among the 212 infants enrolled for in-depth analysis of health care resource utilization, mean and median RSVH charges were $55,551 and $27,461, respectively, which varied by intensity of care required. Outpatient visits were common, with 63% and 62% of infants requiring visits before and within 1 month following the RSVH, respectively. Conclusion Preterm infants 29 to 35 wGA are at high risk for severe RSV disease, which imposes a substantial health burden, particularly in the first months of life. (Anderson E.J.)

57,"Defining the Risk and Associated Morbidity and Mortality of Severe Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection Among Infants with Chronic Lung Disease Introduction: The REGAL (RSV evidencea geographical archive of the literature) series provide a comprehensive review of the published evidence in the field of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in Western countries over the last 20 years. This third publication covers the risk and burden of RSV infection in infants with chronic lung disease (CLD), formerly called bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Methods: A systematic review was undertaken of publications between January 1, 1995 and December 31, 2015 across PubMed, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and Clinicaltrials.gov. Studies reporting data for hospital visits/admissions for RSV infection among infants with CLD/BPD who were not prophylaxed, as well as studies reporting RSV-associated morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs, were included. Burdens of disease data were compared with preterm infants without CLD/BPD, other high-risk groups and term infants. Study quality and strength of evidence (SOE) were graded using recognized criteria. Results: A total of 1837 studies were identified and 39 were included. CLD/BPD is a significant independent risk factor for RSV hospitalization [RSVH (odds ratio 2.27.2); high SOE]. Infants and young children with CLD/BPD had high RSVH rates which were generally similar in Europe, the United States, and Canada, mostly varying between 12 and 21%. Infants with CLD also had a longer length of hospital stay than other high-risk groups and term infants (high SOE). On average, infants spent 411 days in hospital (moderate SOE). Once hospitalized for RSV, affected children were at risk for a more severe course of disease than children with no RSVH (moderate SOE). Conclusion: Severe RSV infection in infants and young children with CLD/BPD poses a significant health burden in Western countries. Further studies focussing on the burden of RSV infection in this well-recognized population at high risk for severe disease are needed to help improve outcomes and plan allocation of healthcare resources.

58,"Environmental factors linked to hospital admissions in young children due to acute viral lower respiratory infections: A bidirectional case-crossover study Objective: This study evaluated the association of the short-term exposure to environmental factors (relative humidity, temperature, NO(2), SO(2), O(3), PM(10), and CO) with hospital admissions due to acute viral lower respiratory infections (ALRI) in children under two years before the COVID-19 era. Methods: We performed a bidirectional case-crossover study in 30,445 children with ALRI under two years of age in the Spanish Minimum Basic Data Set (MBDS) from 2013 to 2015. Environmental data were obtained from Spain's State Meteorological Agency (AEMET). The association was assessed by conditional logistic regression. Results: Lower temperature one week before the day of the event (hospital admission) (q-value = 0.012) and higher relative humidity one week (q-value = 0.003) and two weeks (q-value<0.001) before the day of the event were related to a higher odds of hospital admissions. Higher NO(2) levels two weeks before the event were associated with hospital admissions (q-value<0.001). Moreover, higher concentrations on the day of the event for SO(2) (compared to lag time of 1-week (q-value = 0.026) and 2-weeks (q-value<0.001)), O(3) (compared to lag time of 3-days (q-value<0.001), 1-week (q-value<0.001), and 2-weeks (q-value<0.001)), and PM(10) (compared to lag time of 2-weeks (q-value<0.001)) were related to an increased odds of hospital admissions for viral ALRI. Conclusion: Short-term exposure to environmental factors (climatic conditions and ambient air contaminants) was linked to a higher likelihood of hospital admissions due to ALRI. Our findings emphasize the importance of monitoring environmental factors to assess the odds of ALRI hospital admissions and plan public health resources. (Alvaro-Meca A.)

59,"Decreased public pursuit of cancer-related information during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States Background: In response to the prioritization of healthcare resources towards the COVID-19 pandemic, routine cancer screening and diagnostic have been disrupted, potentially explaining the apparent COVID-era decline in cancer cases and mortality. In this study, we identified temporal trends in public interest in cancer-related health information using the nowcasting tool Google Trends. Methods: We used Google Trends to query search terms related to cancer types for short-term (September 2019September 2020) and long-term (September 2016September 2020) trends in the US. We compared average relative search volumes (RSV) for specified time ranges to detect recent and seasonal variation. Results: General search interest declined for all cancer types beginning in March 2020, with changes in search interest for Breast cancer, Colorectal cancer, and Melanoma of  30.6%,  28.2%, and  26.7%, respectively, and compared with the mean RSV of the two previous months. In the same time range, search interest for Telemedicine has increased by + 907.1% and has reached a 4-year peak with a sustained increased level of search interest. Absolute cancer mortality has declined and is presently at a 4-year low; however, search interest in cancer has been recuperating since July 2020. Conclusion: We observed a marked decline in searches for cancer-related health information that mirrors the reduction in new cancer diagnoses and cancer mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic. Health professions need to be prepared for the coming demand for cancer-related healthcare, foreshadowed by recovering interest in cancer-related information on Google Trends.

60,"Total healthcare costs in the US for preterm infants with respiratory syncytial virus lower respiratory infection in the first year of life requiring medical attention Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory infection (LRI) is the most common cause of hospitalization among infants <1 year of age. The healthcare costs of preterm infants with RSV LRI were compared with those without RSV LRI in the first year of life. Methods: This retrospective cohort study propensity-matched premature infants 36 weeks' gestational age (wGA) and/or 2499 g birth weight, born May 1, 2001 through April 30, 2006 (five RSV seasons) with RSV LRI to those without RSV LRI in a national United States health plan. The primary outcome was first-year healthcare costs and utilization excluding the birth hospitalization compared between the study cohorts. Subgroup analysis evaluated costs and healthcare resource utilization by GA (32 wGA and 33-36 wGA) and hospitalization status (hospitalized and outpatient). Results: A total of 2995 infants with RSV LRI were matched to 2995 controls. Infants with RSV LRI had $9115 higher healthcare costs (RSV LRI group: $19 559; control group: $10 444; p<0.001) in the first year of life. Late preterm infants (33-36 wGA) with an RSV hospitalization incurred $21 977 higher costs (p<0.001) and those with an outpatient RSV LRI incurred $3898 higher costs (p<0.001) compared to corresponding controls. Similar results were found among infants 32 wGA with higher costs in the RSV LRI group. Rates of all-cause hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and ambulatory visits were significantly higher among infants with RSV LRI compared to controls. Conclusion: Development of RSV LRI among preterm and late preterm infants is associated with significantly higher healthcare costs in the first year of life. These findings must be considered in the context of potential study limitations that may have over- or underestimated costs, such as unconfirmed RSV infection, unintentional omission of fatal cases, and unobserved imbalances between groups.  2009 Informa UK Ltd.

61,"Validation of a pediatric caregiver diary to measure symptoms of postacute respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis Acute respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-induced bronchiolitis is often associated with continuing respiratory symptoms following hospitalization. To date, there is no validated objective measure to evaluate symptoms of RSV-induced bronchiolitis. We report on the reliability, validity, and responsiveness of the bronchiolitis caregiver diary (BCD) of symptoms and healthcare utilization associated with postacute RSV. The BCD measures four symptoms (daytime cough, wheeze, trouble breathing, and nighttime cough), healthcare utilization, and rescue medication for worsening of lung symptoms. Data from the 4-week treatment period of the reported prospective, placebo-controlled trial of montelukast for treatment of postacute RSV were used to assess reliability (internal consistency and test-retest), construct validity (cross-sectional and longitudinal correlations), discriminant validity (known-groups analyses), and responsiveness. The primary outcome of this study was the percentage of symptom-free days (SFD). The secondary outcome was a composite symptom score (CSS; average of daytime cough, wheezing, and trouble breathing). Cronbach's alpha of 0.85 indicated that the four symptoms were internally consistent, supporting a unidimensional scale structure. Test-retest reliabilities for the percentage of SFD and CSS were above the recommended cut point of 0.70. Cross-sectional and longitudinal correlations were sizeable and statistically significant, demonstrating construct validity. Hypothesized known-group differences were statistically significant in the appropriate direction. Responsiveness analyses indicated moderate effect sizes for percentage of SFD. In conclusion, the BCD provides a valid, reliable, and responsive tool for the assessment of symptoms of postacute RSV-induced bronchiolitis, capable of measuring moderate effect sizes, and demonstrating responsiveness to therapy.  2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

62,"Economic burden and health-related quality-of-life among infants with respiratory syncytial virus infection: A multi-country prospective cohort study in Europe Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes a considerable disease burden in young children globally, but reliable estimates of RSV-related costs and health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) are scarce. This study aimed to evaluate the RSV-associated costs and HRQoL effects in infants and their caregivers in four European countries. Methods: Healthy term-born infants were recruited at birth and actively followed up in four European countries. Symptomatic infants were systematically tested for RSV. Caregivers recorded the daily HRQoL of their child and themselves, measured by a modified EQ-5D with Visual Analogue Scale, for 14 consecutive days or until symptoms resolved. At the end of each RSV episode, caregivers reported healthcare resource use and work absenteeism. Direct medical costs per RSV episode were estimated from a healthcare payer's perspective and indirect costs were estimated from a societal perspective. Means and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of direct medical costs, total costs (direct costs + productivity loss) and quality-adjusted life-day (QALD) loss per RSV episode were estimated per RSV episode, as well as per subgroup (medical attendance, country). Results: Our cohort of 1041 infants experienced 265 RSV episodes with a mean symptom duration of 12.5 days. The mean (95% CI) cost per RSV episode was 399.5 (242.3, 584.2) and 494.3 (317.7, 696.1) from the healthcare payer's and societal perspective, respectively. The mean QALD loss per RSV episode of 1.9 (1.7, 2.1) was independent of medical attendance (in contrast to costs, which also differed by country). Caregiver and infant HRQoL evolved similarly. Conclusion: This study fills essential gaps for future economic evaluations by prospectively estimating direct and indirect costs and HRQoL effects on healthy term infants and caregivers separately, for both medically attended (MA) and non-MA laboratory-confirmed RSV episodes. We generally observed greater HRQoL losses than in previous studies which used non-community and/or non-prospective designs. (Mao Z., Zhuxin.Mao@uantwerpen.be; Li X.; Hens N.; Bilcke J.; Beutels P.)

63,"How has the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic changed the epidemiology and management of acute bronchiolitis? Objective: SARS-COV-2 pandemic profoundly impacted acute bronchiolitis epidemiology worldwide, especially respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) diffusion and the burden of disease, with remarkable implications on the management of health resources. We aimed to study the epidemiology and clinical course of bronchiolitis in the past 5 years in our region and to assess the trends that occurred during and after the SARS-COV-2 pandemic. Methods: We conducted an observational study including all children aged 02 years with bronchiolitis admitted to a tertiary children's hospital during the last 5 years. Demographic, clinical, and microbiological data were collected. Comparisons between patient subgroups were carried out. Results: A total of 647 patients admitted for bronchiolitis were included (median age 78 days). Molecular diagnostic tests were performed in 617 patients (95.4%) with RSV detected in 51.5% of patients in prepandemic years and 74.5% in pandemic years. Through the study period, we observed a progressive increase in the number of children requiring respiratory support, RSV infections, and children with a history of prematurity. Conversely, this was not true for mechanical ventilation, duration of respiratory support, intensive care unit admission, and length of stay. Conclusions: Clinical course and epidemiology of bronchiolitis showed a significant change through the study years with a heavy impact during the 20212022 season. The increase in the number of patients requiring respiratory support, although not associated with an increase in mechanical ventilation, may be explained by the higher prevalence of RSV. The change in epidemiology highlights the importance of surveillance systems to monitor RSV circulation, to plan prophylactic strategies, and prepare healthcare systems.

64,"Respiratory viral infections in infancy and school age respiratory outcomes and healthcare costs Objectives: To determine the impact of viral lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in infancy including rhinovirus (RV) and infancy respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), on school age pulmonary function and healthcare utilization in prematurely born children. Working hypothesis: School age respiratory outcomes would be worse and healthcare utilization greater in children who had viral LRTIs in infancy. Study design: Prospective study. Subject selection: A cohort of prematurely born children who had symptomatic LRTIs during infancy documented, was recalled. Methods: Pulmonary function was assessed at 5 to 7 years of age and health related costs of care from aged one to follow-up determined. Results: Fifty-one children, median gestational age 33(+6) weeks, were assessed at a median (IQR) age 7.03 (6.377.26) years. Twenty-one children had no LRTI, 14 RV LRTI, 10 RSV LRTI, and 6 another viral LRTI (other LRTI). Compared to the no LRTI group, the RV group had a lower FEV(1) (P = 0.033) and the other LRTI group a lower FVC (P = 0.006). Non-respiratory medication costs were higher in the RV (P = 0.018) and RSV (P = 0.013) groups. Overall respiratory healthcare costs in the RV (153/year) and RSV (27/year) groups did not differ significantly from the no LRTI group (56/year); the other LRTI group (431/year) had higher respiratory healthcare costs (P = 0.042). Conclusions: In moderately prematurely born children, RV and RSV LRTIs in infancy were not associated with higher respiratory healthcare costs after infancy. Children who experienced LRTIs caused by other respiratory viruses (including RV) had higher respiratory healthcare costs and greater pulmonary function impairment.

65,"Estimating the economic burden of respiratory syncytial virus infections in infants in Vietnam: a cohort study BACKGROUND: Little information is available on the costs of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in Vietnam or other low- and middle-income countries. Our study estimated the costs of LRTIs associated with RSV infection among children in southern Vietnam. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study evaluating household and societal costs associated with LRTIs stratified by RSV status and severity among children under 2 years old who sought care at a major pediatric referral hospital in southern Vietnam. Enrollment periods were September 2019-December 2019, October 2020-June 2021 and October 2021-December 2021. RSV status was confirmed by a validated RT-PCR assay. RSV rapid detection antigen (RDA) test performance was also evaluated. Data on resource utilization, direct medical and non-medical costs, and indirect costs were collected from billing records and supplemented by patient-level questionnaires. All costs are reported in 2022 US dollars. RESULTS: 536 children were enrolled in the study, with a median age of 7 months (interquartile range [IQR] 3-12). This included 210 (39.2%) children from the outpatient department, 318 children (59.3%) from the inpatient respiratory department (RD), and 8 children (1.5%) from the intensive care unit (ICU). Nearly 20% (105/536) were RSV positive: 3.9 percent (21/536) from the outpatient department, 15.7% (84/536) from the RD, and none from the ICU. The median total cost associated with LRTI per patient was US$52 (IQR 32-86) for outpatients and US$184 (IQR 109-287) for RD inpatients. For RSV-associated LRTIs, the median total cost per infection episode per patient was US$52 (IQR 32-85) for outpatients and US$165 (IQR 95-249) for RD inpatients. Total out-of-pocket costs of one non-ICU admission of RSV-associated LRTI ranged from 32%-70% of the monthly minimum wage per person (US$160) in Ho Chi Minh City. The sensitivity and the specificity of RSV RDA test were 88.2% (95% CI 63.6-98.5%) and 100% (95% CI 93.3-100%), respectively. CONCLUSION: These are the first data reporting the substantial economic burden of RSV-associated illness in young children in Vietnam. This study informs policymakers in planning health care resources and highlights the urgency of RSV disease prevention. (Do L.A.H., lienanhha.do@mcri.edu.au; Mulholland K.)

66,"Acute care utilization due to hospitalizations for pediatric lower respiratory tract infections in British Columbia, Canada. Pediatric LRTI hospitalizations are a significant burden on patients, families, and healthcare systems. This study determined the burden of pediatric LRTIs on hospital settings in British Columbia and the benefits of prevention strategies as they relate to healthcare resource demand. LRTI inpatient episodes for patients <19 years of age during 2008-2010 were extracted from the BC Discharge Abstract Database. The annual number of acute care beds required to treat pediatric LRTIs was estimated. Sub-analyses determined the burden due to infants <1 year of age and high-risk infants. Population projections were used to forecast LRTI hospitalizations and the effectiveness of public health initiatives to reduce the incidence of LRTIs to 2020 and 2030. During 2008-2010, LRTI as the primary diagnosis accounted for 32.0 and 75.9% hospitalizations for diseases of the respiratory system in children <19 years of age and infants <1 year of age, respectively. Infants <1 year of age accounted for 47 and 77% hospitalizations due to pediatric LRTIs and pediatric LRTI hospitalizations specifically due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), respectively. The average length of stay was 3.1 days for otherwise healthy infants <1 year of age and 9.1 days for high-risk infants (P <0.0001). 73.1% pediatric LRTI hospitalizations occurred between November and April. Over the study timeframe, 19.6 acute care beds were required on average to care for pediatric LRTIs which increased to 64.0 beds at the peak of LRTI hospitalizations. Increases in LRTI bed-days of 5.5 and 16.2% among <19 year olds by 2020 and 2030, respectively, were predicted. Implementation of appropriate prevention strategies could cause 307 and 338 less LRTI hospitalizations in <19 year olds in 2020 and 2030, respectively. Pediatric LRTI hospitalizations require significant use of acute care infrastructure particularly between November and April. Population projections show the burden may increase in the next 20 years, but implementation of effective public health prevention strategies may contribute to reducing the acute care demand and to supporting efforts for overall pediatric healthcare sustainability.

67,"Palivizumab for respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis in high-risk infants: A cost-effectiveness analysis Background: Prophylactic therapy with palivizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, has been shown to reduce the number of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-related hospitalizations in preterm infants. The cost-effectiveness of this therapy has not been evaluated from the provider's perspective using cost data. Objectives: The objectives of this study were to determine the cost per RSV infection episode avoided by using prophylactic palivizumab therapy in a high-risk infant population and to determine whether certain subgroups of infants derived greater benefit from prophylactic therapy. Methods: A decision-analytic model simulating an RSV infection episode was developed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of palivizumab prophylaxis from the perspective of the health care system (provider). Data to populate the model were gathered from the medical literature (identified through a MEDLINE search of studies on the incidence of RSV infection) and the IMpact-RSV clinical trial. Data included incidence of RSV infection and the associated health care resource use and costs. Costs to the provider were determined using a university-affiliated hospital cost-accounting system. Cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated over a range of RSV infection incidence rates in a control population. Sensitivity analyses were performed for the cost of palivizumab therapy, the cost of RSV-related hospitalization, and the number of emergency department, physician office, and home health care visits. For the subgroup analysis, infants were classified by gestational age (<32 and 32 weeks) and stratified by severity of chronic lung disease. Results: The cost per additional RSV infection episode avoided ranged from $0 (cost savings) to $39,591 for palivizumab prophylaxis costs of $2500 and from $2702 to $79,706 for palivizumab prophylaxis costs of $4500. The model was insensitive to changes in the number of emergency department, physician office, and home health care visits. The difference in RSV incidence between the treatment and control groups was greater among infants 32 weeks' gestational age than among infant < 32 weeks' gestational age. Conclusions: The incremental cost-effectiveness of palivizumab compared with no prophylactic therapy was sensitive to changes in the incidence of RSV infection in control infants, the average cost of RSV hospitalization, and the cost of palivizumab. Clinicians may use this information along with additional factors to determine whether palivizumab is cost-effective in their clinical setting and geographic area.

68,"Economic Burden and Health-Related Quality of Life of Respiratory Syncytial Virus and Influenza Infection in European Community-Dwelling Older Adults Background. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus infections result in a considerable mortality and morbidity among the aging population globally. Influenza vaccination for older adults before the seasonal influenza epidemic has been evaluated to be cost-effective in many countries. Interventions against RSV in older adults are in the pipeline, and evaluating their cost-effectiveness is crucial for decision making. To inform such evaluations, our aim was to estimate average costs and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in older adults with RSV and influenza infection. Methods. The European RESCEU observational cohort study followed 1040 relatively healthy community-dwelling older adults aged 60 years and older during 2 consecutive winter seasons. Health care resource use and HRQoL were collected and analyzed during RSV episodes, and also during influenza episodes. Country-specific unit cost data were mainly obtained from national databases. Direct costs were estimated from a patient, health care provider, and health care payers perspective, whereas indirect costs were estimated from a societal perspective. Due to small sample size, no formal statistical comparisons were made. Results. Thirty-six RSV and 60 influenza episodes were reported, including 1 hospitalization. Means (median; first-third quartile) of 26.4 (5.5; 047.3) direct and 4.4 (0; 00) indirect costs were reported per nonhospitalized RSV episode, and 42.5 (36; 3.366.7) direct and 32.1 (0; 00) indirect costs per nonhospitalized influenza episode. For RSV episodes, the utility value decreased from 0.896 (0.928; 0.8540.953) to 0.801 (0.854; 0.7120.937) from preseason to 1 week after symptom onset; for influenza, the change was from 0.872 (0.895; 0.8280.953) to 0.664 (0.686; 0.5740.797). Conclusions. The average costs and HRQoL estimates of older adults treated outside the hospital can be used to inform the design of future studies and the decision making regarding interventions to prevent RSV infection in older adults. Larger studies are needed to provide better country-specific and complementary cost estimates and to allow for formal statistical comparison of costs between RSV and influenza.

69,"Seasonality of primary care utilization for respiratory diseases in Ontario: A time-series analysis Background. Respiratory diseases represent a significant burden in primary care. Determining the temporal variation of the overall burden of respiratory diseases on the health care system and their potential causes are keys to understanding disease dynamics in populations and can contribute to the rational management of health care resources. Methods. A retrospective, cross-sectional time series analysis was used to assess the presence and strength of seasonal and temporal patterns in primary care visits for respiratory diseases in Ontario, Canada, for a 10-year period from January 1, 1992 to December 31, 2002. Data were extracted from the Ontario Health Insurance Plan database for people who had diagnosis codes for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, pneumonia, or upper respiratory tract infections. Results. The results illustrate a clear seasonal pattern in visits to primary care physicians for all respiratory conditions, with a threefold increase in visits during the winter. Age and sex-specific rates show marked increases in visits of young children and in female adults. Multivariate time series methods quantified the interactions among primary care visits, and Granger causality criterion test showed that the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus influenced asthma (p = 0.0060), COPD (p = 0.0038), pneumonia (p = 0.0001), and respiratory diseases (p = 0.0001). Conclusion. Primary care visits for respiratory diseases have clear predictable seasonal patterns, driven primarily by viral circulations.

70,"Burden of respiratory syncytial virus infection in older and high-risk adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence from developed countries Background Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) significantly impacts the health of older and high-risk adults (those with comorbidities). We aimed to synthesise the evidence on RSV disease burden and RSV-related healthcare utilisation in both populations. Methods We searched Embase and MEDLINE for papers published between 2000 and 2019 reporting the burden and clinical presentation of symptomatic RSV infection and the associated healthcare utilisation in developed countries in adults aged 60 years or at high risk. We calculated pooled estimates using random-effects inverse variance-weighted meta-analysis. Results 103 out of 3429 articles met the inclusion criteria. Among older adults, RSV caused 4.66% (95% CI 3.346.48%) of symptomatic respiratory infections in annual studies and 7.80% (95% CI 5.7710.45%) in seasonal studies; RSV-related case fatality proportion (CFP) was 8.18% (95% CI 5.5411.94%). Among high-risk adults, RSV caused 7.03% (95% CI 5.189.48%) of symptomatic respiratory infections in annual studies, and 7.69% (95% CI 6.239.46%) in seasonal studies; CFP was 9.88% (95% CI 6.6614.43%). Data paucity impaired the calculation of estimates on population incidence, clinical presentation, severe outcomes and healthcare-related utilisation. Conclusions Older and high-risk adults frequently experience symptomatic RSV infection, with appreciable mortality; however, detailed data are lacking. Increased surveillance and research are needed to quantify population-based disease burden and facilitate RSV treatments and vaccine development. (Nguyen-Van-tam J.S.)

71,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation fundamentals: Diagnosis, treatment, prevention and disease impact In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), exacerbations (ECOPD), characterized by an acute deterioration in respiratory symptoms, are fundamental events impacting negatively upon disease progression, comorbidities, wellbeing and mortality. ECOPD also represent the largest component of the socioeconomic burden of COPD. ECOPDs are currently defined as acute worsening of respiratory symptoms that require additional therapy. Definitions that require worsening of dyspnoea and sputum volume/purulence assume that acute infections, especially respiratory viral infections, and/or exposure to pollutants are the main cause of ECOPD. But other factors may contribute to ECOPD, such as the exacerbation of other respiratory diseases and non-respiratory diseases (e.g., heart failure, thromboembolism). The complexity of worsening dyspnoea has suggested a need to improve the definition of ECOPD using objective measurements such as blood counts and C-reactive protein to improve accuracy of diagnosis and a personalized approach to management. There are three time points when we can intervene to improve outcomes: acutely, to attenuate the length and severity of an established exacerbation; in the aftermath, to prevent early recurrence and readmission, which are common, and in the long-term, establishing preventative measures that reduce the risk of future events. Acute management includes interventions such as corticosteroids or antibiotics and measures to support the respiratory system, including non-invasive ventilation (NIV). Current therapies are broad and better understanding of clinical phenotypes and biomarkers may help to establish a more tailored approach, for example in relation to antibiotic prescription. Other unmet needs include effective treatment for viruses, which commonly cause exacerbations. Preventing early recurrence and readmission to hospital is important and the benefits of interventions such as antibiotics or anti-inflammatories in this period are not established. Domiciliary NIV in those patients who are persistently hypercapnic following discharge and pulmonary rehabilitation can have a positive impact. For long-term prevention, inhaled therapy is key. Dual bronchodilators reduce exacerbation frequency but in patients with continuing exacerbations, triple therapy should be considered, especially if blood eosinophils are elevated. Other options include phosphodiesterase inhibitors and macrolide antibiotics. ECOPD are a key component of the assessment of COPD severity and future outcomes (quality of life, hospitalisations, health care resource utilization, mortality) and are a central component in pharmacological management decisions. Targeted therapies directed towards specific pathways of inflammation are being explored in exacerbation prevention, and this is a promising avenue for future research.

72,"Impact of RSV: implications for managed care. Severe RSV disease, manifested as bronchiolitis or pneumonia, is the leading cause of hospitalization of infants younger than 1 year of age in the United States. Infants born 35 weeks or less GA are particularly at high risk of severe RSV disease, which may result in frequent NICU admissions or long hospital stays and additional health care utilization over the first 12 months of life. This care is costly--infants 33 to 36 weeks GA with a history of RSV hospitalization incur costs that are nearly 5 times as much as costs for 33 to 36 weeks GA infants with no history of RSV hospitalization. Managed care payers should be cognizant of the potential ramifications of severe RSV disease in infants. Developing a proactive RSV management strategy can help improve health outcomes and reduce unnecessary hospital resource use. (Makari D.; Hoopes J.M.; White N.)

73,"Clinical relevance of prevention of respiratory syncytial virus lower respiratory tract infection in preterm infants born between 33 and 35 weeks gestational age Premature infants are vulnerable to severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) resulting in hospitalisation and the potential for longer-term respiratory morbidity. Whilst the severity and consequence of RSV LRTI are generally accepted and recognised in infants born 32 weeks gestational age (GA), there is less acknowledgment of the potential consequences in infants born 33-35 weeks GA. However, there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that infants born between 33 and 35 weeks GA may be equally at risk for RSV LRTI as infants born <32 weeks GA. Interrupted lung development and an immature immune system have been linked with an increased susceptibility for RSV LRTI, along with other environmental, social, and physiological risk factors. Currently, the only effective method of preventing RSV LRTI is prophylaxis with palivizumab. Often with limited healthcare resources, identifying infants at greatest risk of RSV LRTI who would potentially benefit most from prophylaxis is highly desirable, particularly in the 33-35-week GA group. The purpose of this article is to examine the causes and consequences of RSV LRTI in infants born 33-35 weeks GA, and look at the potential for using risk factors to identify high risk infants and, thereby, optimise prophylaxis. The causes and consequences of RSV LRTI in infants born 33-35 weeks GAA were determined via literature review. A number of underlying risk factors that significantly increase the risk of severe RSV LRTI and subsequent hospitalisation in this group of infants have been identified, most notably from the FLIP and PICNIC studies. A European predictive model based on the risk factors in the FLIP study has recently been developed and validated, which will aid identification of infants born between 33 and 35 weeks GA with the highest risk of RSV hospitalisation. Implementation of this model and prophylaxis of infants born between 33 and 35 weeks GA should be a national or regional decision, taken in perspective of other public health needs.  2008 Springer-Verlag.

74,"Inpatient and outpatient costs associated with respiratory syncytial virus in Japanese infants and older adults Objective: To evaluate healthcare resource use for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in Japan. Methods: Using JMDC and Medical Data Vision (MDV) claims databases, we retrospectively evaluated cost and length of hospital/intensive care unit stays in RSV-diagnosed cohorts of infants (<12 months) and older adults (OAs, 60 years). We analyzed the usage and costs of palivizumab in infants. Results: Mean costs among those hospitalized were $2823 (USD); $2851; and $6609 (131 [JPY]/$) in JMDC-infant (n = 13,752); MDV-infant (n = 22,142); and MDV-OA cohorts (n = 165), respectively. The mean cost was higher in those aged <1 month, with risk factors, and severe RSV disease. Mean cumulative cost of palivizumab prophylaxis in JMDC infant cohort was $6796/year. Conclusion: RSV causes enormous economic burden in infants and OAs. Plain language summary - Cost of treating respiratory syncytial virus infection in infants & elderly in Japan Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an important disease in infants and older adults that affects the airways. Using two Japanese insurance databases we identified RSV patients aged under 1 year and above 59 years. We examined their healthcare use and calculated the cost within 1 month of the RSV diagnosis - we calculated the cost of RSV treatment in those hospitalized and not hospitalized. We also assessed the use of medicines and the days of stay in hospital or intensive care unit. The cost of treatment of hospitalized infants was more than $2800 per patient. The cost of treatment of hospitalized older adults was $6609 per patient. Clearly, the healthcare costs for hospitalized older adults were much higher than the average cost for hospitalized infants. However, infants aged less than 1 month, with risk factors, and with severe RSV disease had higher costs. The total cost for patients not hospitalized was more in infants than in older adults. Palivizumab can prevent RSV infection in infants. The collective total cost of palivizumab use was more than $6450 per infant aged 11 months. The medical management of RSV infection is very costly, and this is true both for infants and older adults.

75,"Does RSV infection alter the course of chronic lung disease in prematurely born infants? Very premature birth frequently results in chronic respiratory morbidity, particularly if complicated by the development of chronic lung disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Affected infants may remain oxygen dependent for many months and require hospital readmission in the first two years after birth. Troublesome, recurrent respiratory symptoms requiring treatment are common. The worst affected may remain symptomatic with evidence of airways obstruction even as adults. Infant who are born prematurely and develop BPD are at increased risk of severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. RSV infection in prematurely born infants is associated with excess chronic respiratory morbidity, as evidenced by greater frequency of respiratory symptoms, lung function abnormalities and healthcare utilisation. There is some evidence to suggest that prematurely born infants, as those born at term, may be predisposed to symptomatic RSV lower respiratory tract infections by pre-morbid abnormal lung function. Longitudinal studies assessing lung function before and after RSV infection are required to determine whether RSV infection does alter the course of chronic lung disease in prematurely born infants.  2011 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

77,"Determining the outcomes of interventions to prevent respiratory syncytial virus disease in children: what to measure? Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of viral acute lower respiratory tract illness (LRTI) in young children, and a major cause of hospital admissions and health-care utilisation globally. Substantial efforts have been made to develop RSV vaccines and vaccine-like monoclonal antibodies to prevent acute RSV LRTI. Prevention of acute disease could improve long-term lung health, with potential effects on wheezing, asthma, and chronic lung disease. This Personal View describes assessments that should be initiated during clinical trials and continued after licensure to fully evaluate the effect of RSV preventive interventions. These assessments include recording the incidence of RSV-specific LRTI and all-cause LRTI through two RSV seasons, and assessment of the prevalence and severity of recurrent wheezing or asthma in children aged up to 6 years. Standardised assessments in diverse settings are needed to fully determine the effect of interventions for the prevention of RSV disease. (Karron R.A.)

In this issue of Acta Paediatrica, Meberg and Bru report on the incidence and estimated costs of hospitalizations for RSV infections in children with congenital heart disease from a specified region in Norway. Conclusion: Incidence figures of hospitalization due to RSV infection in this high-risk group of infants were similar to the results from several other reports.

79,"RSV vaccine in development: Assessing the potential cost-effectiveness in the Dutch elderly population Objectives: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is increasingly recognized as an important cause of morbidity, mortality and health-care utilization in the elderly population. A theoretical model was built to assess the levels of vaccine effectiveness and vaccine costs for which a hypothetical RSV-vaccine for Dutch elderly could be cost-effective. Methods: Different vaccination strategies were evaluated by changing the levels of vaccine effectiveness and the willingness to pay per quality-adjusted life year gained (QALY). Outcome measures included direct medical costs, QALYs, life years gained, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and the maximum total vaccination costs per individual (i.e. (vaccine price. +. administration costs)  nr of doses) while remaining cost-effective. Results: Using base-case assumptions, it was estimated that vaccination of all persons 60 years and older would prevent 3402. GP visits, 2989 antibiotic prescriptions, 535 hospitalizations and 249 deaths and would cost 73,261 per QALY, for a vaccine effectiveness of 70%. Vaccinating only the high risk population of 60 years and older would reduce the estimates to 2042. GP visits, 2009 antibiotic prescriptions, 179 hospitalizations and 209 deaths and this reduced the cost per QALY to 34,796 per QALY. Using the same assumptions, the maximum total vaccination costs per individual ranged from 26 when vaccinating all persons 60 and older to 68 when vaccinating only persons aged 85 and above, using a willingness to pay threshold of 50,000 per QALY. For the high risk population aged 60 years and older the estimated maximum total vaccination costs ranged from 52 to 99. Conclusion: Vaccination of Dutch elderly against RSV was found cost-effective for several scenarios. As expected, vaccination is more likely to be cost-effective when only including persons who are at increased risk for contracting RSV or the potential complications of RSV. This theoretical study shows that based on the disease burden in the Dutch population aged 60yrs and older there is potential to develop a vaccine that might be considered cost-effective in the Netherlands.  2013 Elsevier Ltd.

80,"Using Google Trends to Predict Pediatric Respiratory Syncytial Virus Encounters at a Major Health Care System To assess whether Google search activity predicts lead-time for pediatric respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) encounters within a major health care system. Internet user search and health system encounter database analysis. Pediatric RSV encounter volumes across all clinics and hospitals in the Duke Health system were tabulated from 2005 to 2016. North Carolina Google user search activity for RSV were obtained over the same time period. Time series analysis was used to compare RSV encounters and search activity. Cross-correlation was used to determine the lag time difference between Google user search interest for RSV and observed Pediatric RSV encounter volumes. Google search activity and Pediatric RSV encounter volumes demonstrated strong seasonality with predilection for winter months. Granger Causality testing revealed that North Carolina RSV Google search activity can predict pediatric RSV encounters at our health system (F = 5.72, p < 0.0001). Using cross-correlation, increases in Google search activity provided lead time of 0.21 weeks (1.47 days) prior to observed increases in Pediatric RSV encounter volumes at our health system. RSV is a common cause of upper airway obstruction in pediatric patients for which pediatric otolaryngologists are consulted. We demonstrate that Google search activity can predict RSV patient interactions with a major health system with a measurable lead-time. The ability to predict when illnesses in a population result in increased health care utilization would be an asset to health system providers, planners and administrators. Prediction of RSV would allow specific care pathways to be developed and resource needs to be anticipated before actual presentation. (Crowson M.G., matt.crowson@mail.utoronto.ca; Eskander A.)

81,"Long-term growth and general health for the tiniest or most immature infants Given the improving survival rates of extremely preterm (EP, gestational age <28 weeks) infants, there is a need to understand their general growth and health outcomes not only in childhood, but also into adulthood. EP children are shorter and lighter compared with term children at term-equivalent age with time, the weight disadvantage diminishes but the height disadvantage remains relatively unchanged. EP children and young adults also have higher rates of reported health concerns, medical conditions and visual impairment. Hospital readmissions are higher in early childhood, mostly attributed to respiratory illness. Individuals born EP have reduced bone health and are at increased risk for metabolic disorders. Increased rates of conditions such as diabetes or pathological fractures are not reported in the literature, although follow-up studies so far have only tracked EP individuals into young adulthood. Consequently, health care utilization and costs are increased in EP children and young adults. A thorough knowledge of the health risks related to EP birth is essential in planning surveillance and intervention strategies to optimize their health and wellbeing. Despite the increased risk of health problems, EP young adults generally report their quality of life to be similar to that reported in their term counterparts.  2013 Elsevier Ltd.

82,"Comparisons between ethnic groups in hospitalizations for respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis in Israel Background Ethnic disparities have been shown in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis. However, it is unclear whether such differences are related to access to care. We compared demographic and clinical characteristics of Arab and Jewish children hospitalized for RSV bronchiolitis in Israel, a country with universal health insurance. Methods We reviewed the medical records of all children (n = 309) aged less than 24 months who were hospitalized with RSV between 2008 and 2011 in one medical center in Israel. Demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiological data were collected. The RSV antigen was identified using immunochromatography. Results The annual incidence of RSV hospitalization was 5.4/1000 and 6.8/1000 among Arab and Jewish children, respectively. Arab patients were significantly younger and had significantly younger parents; most lived in low socioeconomic status towns (93.7% vs. 13.3%; p<0.001) and had more siblings (median 2 vs. 1; p = 0.01) compared to Jewish patients. Disease severity did not differ between the two ethnic groups (p = 0.3). The main predictors of severe illness were having pneumonia (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 3.86; 95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.877.97) and history of respiratory diseases (adjusted OR 3.89; 95% CI 1.2212.38). Conclusions The incidence of hospitalizations for RSV bronchiolitis tended to be higher among Jewish than Arab children, possibly due to differences in health care utilization patterns. Differences between the Jewish and Arab patients in demographic factors likely mirror differences between the groups in the general population.

83,"The association between weather conditions and admissions to the paediatric intensive care unit for respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis is a leading cause of global child morbidity and mortality. Every year, seasonal RSV outbreaks put high pressure on paediatric intensive care units (PICUs) worldwide, including in the Netherlands, and this burden appears to be increasing. Weather conditions have a strong influence on RSV activity, and climate change has been proposed as a potential important determinant of future RSV-related health care utilisation. In this national study spanning a total of 13 years with 2161 PICU admissions for RSV bronchiolitis, we aimed (1) to identify meteorological variables that were associated with the number of PICU admissions for RSV bronchiolitis in the Netherlands and (2) to determine if longitudinal changes in these variables occurred over time as a possible explanation for the observed increase in PICU burden. Poisson regression modelling was used to identify weather variables (aggregated in months and weeks) that predicted PICU admissions, and linear regression analysis was used to assess changes in the weather over time. Maximum temperature and global radiation best predicted PICU admissions, with global radiation showing the most stable strength of effect in both month and week data. However, we did not observe a significant change in these weather variables over the 13-year time period. Based on our study, we could not identify changing weather conditions as a potential contributing factor to the increased RSV-related PICU burden in the Netherlands.

84,"Chronic manifestations of respiratory syncytial virus infection in premature infants BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in healthy infants born at term results in long term sequelae. Infants born prematurely are at increased risk of severe acute RSV infection; thus it would seem likely that such infants would be at increased risk of long term respiratory sequelae. METHODS: Methods of assessing the long term outcome of RSV infection are discussed and the results of retrospective and prospective studies investigating chronic respiratory morbidity after RSV infection in premature infants are reviewed. RESULTS: Documentation of all health care utilization, parental documentation of symptom status and lung function measurement provide a comprehensive and quantitative assessment of respiratory outcome. Studies that have included such outcome measures have demonstrated that RSV hospitalization in infants born between 32 and 35 weeks of gestational age and in those born more prematurely who developed chronic lung disease was associated with more hospital admissions, inpatient days, physician contacts and outpatient visits in the first 2 years after birth. Children born before 32 weeks of gestation who developed chronic lung disease also required more outpatient attendances and prescriptions and respiratory medications in years 2 through 4. Prospective data collection has demonstrated that chronic respiratory morbidity occurs in very premature infants, regardless of whether their RSV infection required hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Chronic respiratory morbidity is increased in premature infants after RSV infection. The duration of this increased morbidity and the impact of other viral infections, particularly dual infection with RSV, on long term sequelae merit investigation.  2005 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

85,"Long-term respiratory consequences of premature birth at less than 32 weeks of gestation Chronic respiratory morbidity is a common adverse outcome of very premature birth, particularly in infants who had developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Prematurely born infants who had BPD may require supplementary oxygen at home for many months and affected infants have increased healthcare utilisation until school age. Chest radiograph abnormalities are common; computed tomography of the chest gives predictive information in children with ongoing respiratory problems. Readmission to hospital is common, particularly for those who have BPD and suffer respiratory syncytial virus lower respiratory infections (RSV LRTIs). Recurrent respiratory symptoms requiring treatment are common and are associated with evidence of airways obstruction and gas trapping. Pulmonary function improves with increasing age, but children with BPD may have ongoing airflow limitation. Lung function abnormalities may be more severe in those who had RSV LRTIs, although this may partly be explained by worse premorbid lung function. Worryingly, lung function may deteriorate during the first year. Longitudinal studies are required to determine if there is catch up growth.  2013 Elsevier Ltd.

86,"Immunisation status of children presenting to the emergency department: Linkage of a longitudinal birth cohort with national immunisation data Aim: To describe the relationship between emergency department (ED) diagnosis of infectious disease and immunisation status in children 5 years. We also aimed to demonstrate feasibility of proof-of-concept linkage between disparate databases. Methods: Data from a cohort of 3404 children born in Southeast Queensland/Far North New South Wales between 2006 and 2011 were linked to Australian Childhood Immunisation Registry data and Emergency Department Information System data for presentations between 2006 and 2014. Immunisation status was assigned using the 2009 National Immunisation Program schedule. Results: Of 1490 children (79% of those consented) with data on immunisation status, 87.2 and 84.6% were fully immunised by 12 and 24 months, respectively. Adding partially immunised children increased this to 93.2 and 91.4% at 12 and 24 months, respectively. Nearly two-thirds of all children made at least one ED presentation. Children presenting to ED with an infectious disease did not differ in immunisation status compared to children with other (non-infectious disease type) presentations but were younger, more likely to live with other children and had a longer ED stay and higher admission rate. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was more frequently diagnosed in unimmunised children. Conclusions: In an existing birth cohort, immunisation rates were lower than the national average. RSV was more prevalent in unimmunised children presenting to ED, but immunisation status was not significantly associated with other infectious disease presentations.

87,"Respiratory syncytial virus-associated acute respiratory illness in adult non-immunocompromised patients: Outcomes, determinants of outcomes, and the effect of oral ribavirin treatment Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an increasingly common cause of respiratory illness in adult non-immunocompromised patients. Oral ribavirin was reported to improve outcomes of RSV infection in immunocompromised patients. This study aimed to determine the outcomes of non-immunocompromised patients hospitalized with RSV-associated acute respiratory illnesses (RSV-ARI), the factors independently associated with the outcomes and the effect of oral ribavirin treatment. Methods: This retrospective, observational cohort study included 175 adults admitted to the hospital with virologically confirmed RSV-ARI during 20142019. Severe ARI was identified using Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society (IDSA/ATS) criteria for severe community-acquired pneumonia. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality within 30 days after enrollment. A multivariable Cox model was performed to identify significant predictors of mortality. Results: Mean age was 76  12.7 years. Seventy-eight (44.6%) patients met the diagnostic criteria for severe ARI. Thirty-six (20.6%) patients required invasive mechanical ventilation, and 11 (6.3%) required vasopressor. Ninety-nine (56.6%) patients received oral ribavirin treatment, and 52 (29.7%) received systemic corticosteroids. Forty-one (23.4%) patients had evidence of bacterial infection. Overall mortality was 7.4%. Mortality among patients with non-severe ARI and severe ARI was 1.04% and 15.4%, respectively. Estimated glomerular filtration rate <50 ml/min/1.73 m(2), severe ARI, systemic corticosteroids, and bacterial infection were independently associated with higher risk of mortality. Treatment with oral ribavirin was the only factor associated with reduced mortality (adjusted HR: 0.19, 95% CI: 0.040.9, P = 0.03). Conclusion: RSV-ARI may result in significant mortality and health care utilization. Treatment with oral ribavirin may improve survival in these patients.

88,"Characteristics and Outcomes of Young Children Hospitalized with Laboratory-confirmed Influenza or Respiratory Syncytial Virus in Ontario, Canada, 2009-2014 Background: Respiratory illnesses are a major contributor to pediatric hospitalizations, with influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causing substantial morbidity and cost each season. We compared the characteristics and outcomes of children 0-59 months of age who were hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed influenza or RSV between 2009 and 2014 in Ontario, Canada. Methods: We included hospitalized children who were tested for influenza A, influenza B and RSV and were positive for a single virus. We characterized individuals by their demographics and healthcare utilization patterns and compared their hospital outcomes, in-hospital cost and postdischarge healthcare use by virus type and by presence of underlying comorbidities. Results: We identified and analyzed 7659 hospitalizations during which a specimen tested positive for influenza or RSV. Children with RSV were the youngest whereas children with influenza B were the oldest [median ages 6 months (interquartile range: 2-17 months) and 25 months (interquartile range: 10-45 months), respectively]. Complex chronic conditions were more prevalent among children with all influenza (sub)types than RSV (31%-34% versus 20%). In-hospital outcomes were similar by virus type, but in children with comorbidities, postdischarge outcomes varied. We observed no differences in in-hospital cost between viruses or by presence of comorbidities [overall median cost: $4150 Canadian dollars (interquartile range: $3710-$4948)]. Conclusions: Influenza and RSV account for large numbers of pediatric hospitalizations. RSV and influenza were similar in terms of severity and cost in hospitalized children. Influenza vaccination should be promoted in pregnant women and young children, and a vaccine against RSV would mitigate the high burden of RSV.

89,"Bronchiolitis caused by influenza type A virus. An emerging infectious disease OBJECTIVES: To prospectively study the emergence and diagnostic problems of bronchiolitis caused by influenza A virus among children durign the 1999-2000 influenza epidemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Negative respiratory syncitial virus (RSV) specimens (ELISA dot-blot) were seeded in the MDCK cell line for the isolation of influenza A virus, by the shell-vial technique. Vials were revealed by indirect immunofluorescence with antibodies directed against the influenza A virus nucleoprotein (Monofluookit IA, Pasteur Diagnostics). The clinical and epidemiologic features of patients with viral recovery were studied. A theoretical cost/benefit study was performed on the usefulness of the rapid antigenic detection of the influenza A virus. RESULTS: A total of 117 cases of respiratory infection caused by influenza A virus were detected. In 62 cases (52.9%) the diagnosis was bronchiolitis. Of them, 80.6% of cases were aged less than 6 years. Subtype H3N2 predominated in all respiratory infections, paticularly in bronchiolitis. During the 1999-2000 season, a significant emergence of bronchiolitis caused by influenza A virus was observed (week 3, 30% cases of influenza A versus 24% of RSV). The cost/benefit study disclosed that the antigenic detection of RSV and influenza A virus in all respiratory specimens would amount up to 30.83 Euros/specimen. CONCLUSIONS: During the last influenza epidemic, an emergence of bronchiolitis caused by influenza A virus among children was observed and confirmed. Based upon this observation, a dual strategy should be followed. On the one hand, a prophylactic approach (immunization of pregnant women); on the other hand, a diagnostic approach with a rapid antigenic detection of the influenza A virus.

90,"Morbidity patterns among low-income wheezing infants Objective. This study describes morbidity attributable to wheezing illness in a multi-ethnic sample of low-income infants younger than age 2, and examines biological, environmental, and psychosocial correlates of morbidity indexes. Method. Infants 9 to 24 months old, considered at risk for developing asthma on the basis of having had 3 or more health care contacts with documented wheezing, received comprehensive evaluations as part of an environmental intervention study. Baseline evaluations with the infants, their families, and their home environments focused on biological, environmental, and psychosocial factors that would potentially increase asthma risk for the children. At study entry, prior morbidity attributable to wheezing illness was assessed with caregiver reports of symptom frequency and severity and medication use, caregiver quality of life, and medical record documentation of hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits. Results. Forty-six percent of the infants had 1 or more hospitalizations and 59% had 2 or more ED visits since birth for wheezing illness. Foreign-born Hispanic families had significantly more ED visits for their children's wheezing illness than US-born Hispanic families, whites, or blacks, although they used fewer controller medications and they reported less illness severity. Multivariate analyses showed 3 biological factors, respiratory syncytial virus, elevated child IgE, and cockroach allergen in the home, were independently associated with hospitalizations within this sample. Similar analyses showed that ED visits were not associated with biological variables, but rather with caregivers with single parent status and smokers. Caregiver reports of wheezing illness severity were correlated with ED visits, but not with hospitalizations. Severity ratings were higher for children of mothers with asthma and for those whose caregivers had higher anxiety and stress. The only correlate of caregiver ratings of poor quality of life was high caregiver anxiety. Conclusions. Ethnic and immigrant status was an important factor in morbidity attributable to infant wheezing illness. In addition to respiratory infection, both allergic processes and social variables were associated with morbidity as measured by health care utilization. Caregiver reports of illness severity were significantly correlated with psychosocial factors. (Klinnert M.D., klinnertm@njc.org; Price M.R.; Liu A.H.) Department of Pediatrics, Natl.

91,"Respiratory syncytial virus immunization program for the United States: Impact of performance determinants of a theoretical vaccine Objectives: To inform strategic decisions on respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine development and identify critical endpoints likely to drive the vaccine's medical and economic impact. Design: A decision-analysis model populated using healthcare utilization data and costs from the literature; vaccine efficacy and duration based on assumptions. Setting: Vaccination in the physician office setting in the USA. Participants: A hypothetical cohort of newborn infants. Intervention: Vaccination of children at low and high risk of respiratory sequelae with a theoretical RSV vaccine vs palivizumab prophylaxis for children at high risk. Outcome measures: Medical and economic value of RSV vaccination, including cost per quality adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Results: Using base-case assumptions (efficacy 50% at birth; half-life 12. months), RSV vaccination would prevent 23,069 hospitalizations and 66 deaths per vaccinated birth cohort in the USA. Excluding vaccination costs, direct medical costs for RSV would reduce by $236 million, and income and productivity losses by $134 million. Assuming a vaccine cost per course similar to Rotarix in the USA ($232 including administration fees), the cost per QALY gained would be $93,401 (95% CI: $65,815-$126,060) from the healthcare system perspective and $65,115 (95% CI: $41,003-$93,679) from the societal perspective. The net cost (healthcare system perspective) per life-year saved would be $216,120 (95% CI: $161,184-$263,981); the cost per hospitalization averted would be $19,172 (95% CI: $14,679-$22,093). Aside from efficacy, the vaccine's impact is sensitive to the start of protective immunity and the duration of protection. Conclusions: Development of an RSV vaccine would substantially reduce inpatient hospitalizations and outpatient visits. It would also have an impact on infant mortality. To demonstrate the full medical and economic value of the vaccine, appropriate endpoints or endpoint surrogates for hospitalization, mortality, and total case reductions should be collected during vaccine development.  2013 Elsevier Ltd.

92,"Incidence and viral aetiologies of acute respiratory illnesses (ARIs) in the United States: A population-based study We conducted prospective, community-wide surveillance for acute respiratory illnesses (ARIs) in Rochester, NY and Marshfield, WI during a 3-month period in winter 2011. We estimated the incidence of ARIs in each community, tested for viruses, and determined the proportion of ARIs associated with healthcare visits. We used a rolling cross-sectional design to sample participants, conducted telephone interviews to assess ARI symptoms (defined as a current illness with feverishness or cough within the past 7 days), collected nasal/throat swabs to identify viruses, and extracted healthcare utilization from outpatient/inpatient records. Of 6492 individuals, 321 reported an ARI within 7 days (49% total, 57% in Rochester, 44% in Marshfield); swabs were collected from 208 subjects. The cumulative ARI incidence for the entire 3-month period was 52% in Rochester [95% confidence interval (CI) 42-63] and 35% in Marshfield (95% CI 28-42). A specific virus was identified in 39% of specimens: human coronavirus (13% of samples), rhinovirus (12%), RSV (7%), influenza virus (4%), human metapneumovirus (4%), and adenovirus (1%). Only 39/200 (20%) had a healthcare visit (2/9 individuals with influenza). ARI incidence was ~5% per week during winter.

93,"Rehospitalization Following Neonatal Cardiac Surgery: Risk Factors and Outcomes Objective The aim of the study is to determine the number and indications of unplanned hospital readmissions and emergency room visits for children with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) or transposition of great arteries (TGA). Design This retrospective chart review involved children with HLHS or TGA who underwent neonatal surgical repair in a single Children's Hospital. Statistical analysis (SPSS 22.0) included chi-square test, t-test, and binary logistic regression. Results Our study cohort (n=117) comprised 28 children with HLHS and 89 with TGA who were followed for a mean (standard deviation, SD) duration of 4.7 (3.2) years. Unplanned readmissions (n=153) occurred in 46 (39.3%) children, a mean (SD) number of 1.3 (2.8) for a median (interquartile range, IQR) of 8 (2-28) days per patient. Indications were respiratory (57.5%), gastrointestinal (18.3%), and cardiac (12.4%) in nature. On binary regression, with birth weight, race, and gestational age as covariates, among children with HLHS, increasing gestational age tended to be associated with a lower risk of readmissions (odds ratio [OR] 0.138; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.018-1.031, p=0.054]. The mean (SD) number of emergency room visits (n=261) was 3.2 (9.7) in 42 (35.9%) infants for minor illnesses (64%) or gastrointestinal (13.8%) problems. Conclusion The majority of children with HLHS and TGA have unplanned readmissions. Home-care surveillance programs may reduce health-care utilization in this population.

94,"The cost and safety of multidose use of palivizumab vials Palivizumab is an antirespiratory syncytial virus humanized murine monoclonal antibody that has been shown to reduce the frequency of hospitalization rates of preterm infants infected with respiratory syncytial virus. The United States Food and Drug Administration has approved palivizumab for single-vial dosage; however, if multidose use of single-use vials is proven safe, significant cost savings for respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis would result. A total of 446 palivizumab vials administered to patients during the respiratory syncytial virus seasons of 2004-2006 were examined for bacterial contamination. One single-use vial showed growth of multiple organisms, and all multidose-use vials were culture negative. The cost benefits of multidose palivizumab vials netted a potential average savings of $37 410 per year in this institution. This study suggests that multidose distribution is a possible solution for cost savings with no increased risk to patients. Secondary to the low incidence of complications, the safety of this practice will require a larger study.  2008 Sage Publications.

95,"Risk of RSV-related hospitalization is associated with gestational age in preterm (born at 2934 wGA) infants without outpatient palivizumab administration Palivizumab has been shown to decrease RSV-related hospitalization (RSVH) risk and reduce RSVH severity. American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidance on administration of palivizumab has changed over time; in 2014, palivizumab was no longer recommended in preterm infants born at 29 weeks gestational age (wGA) or later. This studys objective was to describe RSVH risk and severity in preterm infants (2934 wGA) without comorbidities relative to healthy term infants and to each other by gestational age. Using the MarketScan Multi-State Medicaid and Commercial Databases, infants born from July 1, 2014 to June 30, 2019, at 2934 wGA (preterm) and >37 wGA (term) were identified. During RSV seasons (November to March) from 2014 to 2020, claims incurred by infants while they were <6 months old were evaluated for RSVH and RSVH characteristics. This study included 63,351 preterm infants and 1,076,389 term infants without outpatient palivizumab administration. Rate of RSVH was higher in infants with lower wGA at birth and ranged 3.325.72 per 100 infant-seasons in Medicaid-insured infants and 3.214.84 in commercially insured infants. Relative risk of RSVH was 58 times higher in Medicaid-insured preterm infants and 35 times higher in commercially insured preterm infants compared to term infants. ICU admissions and mechanical ventilation were more common during RSVH in preterm infants relative to term infants. RSV-related outpatient healthcare utilization was also 23 times higher in preterm infants born at 3134 wGA. Increased utilization of palivizumab among infants born at 2934 wGA may decrease RSVH rates and result in less severe course in preterm infants with RSVH.

96,"Economic results of a palivizumab seasonal prophylaxis using a cohorting software and vial sharing. BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus is the most important pathogen in lower respiratory tract infection in infants and young children. In high-risk populations it may develop severe, sometimes fatal, lower respiratory tract infections. A proportion of these infants require admission to intensive care units due to the severity of the condition and the level of care needed. Furthermore, we must consider the possible increased risk of asthma following RSV infection in infancy. METHODS: The aim of this work is to show how we strictly coordinated, during the 2008-2009 RSV season, the delivery of prophylaxis while minimising drug cost through vial sharing and cohorting infants with a software performed through Visual Basic programming system. RESULTS: By using this method we have been able to obtain a saving of the 29.2% compared to the theoretical amount. No infant requested hospitalisation for a RSV infection. CONCLUSIONS: Such a model ensures all patients to receive appropriate immunization and thus positively influencing the cost-benefit of palivizumab prophylaxis. We hope that our model of care delivery will be of use to other hospitals. (Coletta E.) UOC Pediatria e UTIN, PO Barone I. Romeo, Patti, Messina, Italy., (Coppolino S.; Federico F.; Fulia F.)"
97,"Burden of Respiratory Viruses in Children Less Than 2 Years Old in a Community-based Longitudinal US Birth Cohort Background: Respiratory viral infections are a major cause of morbidity and hospitalization in young children. Nevertheless, the population burden of respiratory viral infections, especially asymptomatic cases, is not known due to the lack of prospective community-based cohort studies with intensive monitoring. Methods: To address this gap, we enacted the PREVAIL cohort, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-sponsored birth cohort in Cincinnati, Ohio, where children were followed from 0 to 2 years of age. Weekly text surveys were administered to record acute respiratory illnesses (ARIs), which were defined as the presence of cough or fever (38C). Weekly midturbinate nasal swabs were collected and tested using the Luminex Respiratory Pathogen Panel, which detected 16 viral pathogens. Viral infection was defined as 1 positive tests from the same virus or viral subtype 30 days of a previous positive test. Maternal report and medical chart abstractions identified healthcare utilization. Results: From 4/2017 to 7/2020, 245 mother-infant pairs were recruited and followed. From the 13 781 nasal swabs tested, a total of 2211 viral infections were detected, of which 821 (37%) were symptomatic. Children experienced 9.4 respiratory viral infections/child-year; half were rhinovirus/enterovirus. Viral ARI incidence was 3.3 episodes/child-year. Emergency department visits or hospitalization occurred with only 15% of respiratory syncytial virus infections, 10% of influenza infections, and only 4% of all viral infections. Regardless of pathogen, most infections were asymptomatic or mild. Conclusions: Respiratory viral infections are common in children 0-2 years. Most viral infections are asymptomatic or non-medically attended, underscoring the importance of community-based cohort studies.

98,"Respiratory outcome of prematurely born infants following human rhinovirus A and C infections Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are a common cause of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) and are associated with chronic respiratory morbidity. Our aim was to determine whether HRV species A or C were associated with chronic respiratory morbidity and increased health care utilisation in prematurely born infants. A number of 153 infants with a median gestational age of 34 (range 23-35) weeks were prospectively followed. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected whenever the infants had LRTIs regardless of hospitalisation status. Parents completed a respiratory diary card and health questionnaire about their infant when they were 11 and 12 months corrected age, respectively. The health-related cost of care during infancy was calculated from the medical records using the National Health Service (NHS) reference costing scheme and the British National Formulary for children. There were 32 infants that developed 40 HRV LRTIs; samples were available from 23 of the 32 infants for subtyping. Nine infants had HRV-A LRTIs, 13 HRV-C LRTIs, and one infant had a HRV-B LRTI. Exclusion of infants who also had RSV LRTIs revealed that the infants who had a HRV-C LRTI were more likely to wheeze (p<0.0005) and use respiratory medications (p<0.0005) and had more days of wheeze (p=0.01) and used an inhaler (p=0.02) than the no LRTI group. In addition, the respiratory cost of care was greater for the HRV-C LRTI than the no LRTI group (p<0.0005). Conclusion: Our results suggest HRV-C is associated with chronic respiratory morbidity during infancy in prematurely born infants.  2014 Springer-Verlag.

99,"Prevention of infection by respiratory syncytial virus (VRS) by SYNAGYS (PALIVIZUMAB) Infection with respiratory syncytial virus is frequent but most often benign. The serious forms of the illness, which make necessary hospitalisation or care in an Intensive Care Unit, appear in infants of less than 6 weeks and especially in those with underlying pathologies, prematurity, congenital cardiopathies or chronic respiratory illnesses. Palivizumab (SYNAGIS) is mouse humanized monoclonal antibody which is used for prevention by monthly injections before and during the epidemic period. In a pivotal study performed on 1502 infants aged less than 6 months and former prematures of less than 36 weeks gestational age (GA) or aged less than 2 years and preventing a bronchopulmonary dysplasia, 1002 infants received 5 monthly injections, compared with 500 infants treated with placebo. There was a significant reduction of 55% risk of hospitalisation with vRs infections in the treated group, but no significant reduction in the number of stays in intensive care or deaths. The recommandation in France now is to use SYNAGIS in children aged less than 6 months, born with or GA of less then 32 weeks or aged less than 2 years and presenting a bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Questions remain on the cost-benefit ratio of this treatment and the favourable effects of this treatment in children who carry other chronic pulmonary or cardiac pathologies.

100,"Respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis in preterm infants: A cost-effectiveness study from Turkey The main aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) prophylaxis with palivizumab in Turkey, by comparing hospitalization rates and costs as well as results of risk analyses in preterm infants who were treated either with palivizumab or conservatively. This retrospective study was undertaken in two centers on infants born with a gestational age of 32 weeks during the 2010-2011 seasons. Patients were divided into two groups based on status of RSV prophylaxis. The records of 272 infants were included in the final analysis, 201 (73.9%) of which had received palivizumab (Group 1), while 71 (26.1%) were not given any form of RSV prophylaxis. The difference between groups in terms of demographic characteristics and risk factors for RSV infection was statistically insignificant (p>0.05). Thirteen patients (6.5%) in Group 1 and 5 patients (7%) in Group 2 were hospitalized for lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) (p>0.05). In newborns born at 28(6/7) weeks of gestation, RSV prophylaxis with palivizumab was associated with a 38.75% decrease in hospitalization rates due to LRTIs compared to the untreated group (8% in the untreated group vs. 4.9% in the palivizumab group; p=0.577). The hospitalization rate due to LRTIs for infants in Group 1 born after 29-32 weeks of gestation was 7.5% compared to a rate of 6.5% in Group 2, with a statistically insignificant difference (p=0.828). In infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) born at 28(6/7) weeks of gestation, treatment with palivizumab was associated with a 39.1% decrease in LRTI-related hospitalization rates (14.3% in the untreated group vs. 8.7% in the palivizumab group; p=0.677). This clinical study is the first of its kind from Turkey to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of palivizumab treatment as prophylaxis against RSV infections in preterm infants, where hospitalization rates and costs of patients treated with palivizumab were compared with those of infants who were treated conservatively. Our study results suggest that administration of palivizumab does not have any cost benefit, regardless of gestational age. However, a reduction in hospitalization rates in association with palivizumab treatment was observed in infants born at 28(6/7) weeks of gestation with or without BPD.

101,"RSV: Immunoprophylaxis and non-invasive respiratory support in ex-preterms: A northern UK perspective Recent guidance has suggested that immunoprophylaxis with monoclonal antibody against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) should be extended to ex-preterm infants who are moderate-to-late-preterm and discharged home during the RSV season. Noninvasive respiratory support (NIV) for infants with bronchiolitis is becoming widespread with little supporting evidence for efficacy over nonpressure support methods. We used multicentre prospective audit and service evaluation to evaluate whether extension of current practice in line with the guidance would provide a clinical or cost benefit, and whether NIV provides any benefits in the ex-preterm population. The prevalence of bronchiolitic illness requiring admission in our population was similar to other studies (2.5%). We found that the majority of ex-preterm infants with RSV positive bronchiolitis who required NIV did not meet the extended criteria for immunisation. Our data suggest that extending RSV prophylaxis as recommended would be unlikely to reduce numbers of infants requiring respiratory support for RSV. NIV use has been widely adopted (9% of 'bronchiolitic' admissions) in our region but the data do not support it as a useful adjunct for ex-preterms with RSV positive illness requiring respiratory support: it does not appear to reduce the need for subsequent formal ventilation. Our study does not support a case for change to more widespread, protocol driven immunisation for RSV. Further research is needed in a randomised, controlled setting to examine the use of NIV in bronchiolitis in a wider context. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2015; 50:1119-1127.

102,"Effect of the COVID-19 Mitigation Measure on Dental Care Needs in 17 Countries: A Regression Discontinuity Analysis Objectives: The effect of COVID-19 mitigation measures on different oral health care needs is unclear. This study aimed to estimate the effect of COVID-19 mitigation measures on different types of oral health care utilization needs and explore the heterogeneity of such effects in different countries by using real-time Internet search data. Methods: Data were obtained from Google Trends and other public databases. The monthly relative search volume (RSV) of the search topics ""toothache,"" ""gingivitis,"" ""dentures,"" ""orthodontics,"" and ""mouth ulcer"" from January 2004 to June 2021 was collected for analysis. The RSV value of each topics before and after COVID-19 was the primary outcome, which was estimated by regression discontinuity analysis (RD). The effect bandwidth time after the COVID-19 outbreak was estimated by the data-driven optimal mean square error bandwidth method. Effect heterogeneity of COVID-19 on dental care was also evaluated in different dental care categories and in countries with different human development index (HDI) rankings, dentist densities, and population age structures. Results: A total of 17,850 monthly RSV from 17 countries were used for analysis. The RD results indicated that advanced dental care was significantly decreased (OR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.47-0.85) after the COVID-19 outbreak, while emergency dental care toothache was significantly increased (OR: 1.54, 95% CI: 0.99-2.37) 4 months after the COVID-19 outbreak. Compared to the countries with low HDI and low dentist density, the effect was much more evident in countries with high HDI and high dentist density. Conclusions: COVID-19 mitigation measures have different effects on people with various dental care needs worldwide. Dental care services should be defined into essential care and advanced care according to specific socioeconomic status in different countries. Targeted health strategies should be conducted to satisfy different dental care needs in countries. (Qu X.; Zhang W.)

103,"COVID-19 PandemicRelated Reductions in Pediatric Asthma Exacerbations Corresponded with an Overall Decrease in Respiratory Viral Infections Background: Respiratory viruses, air pollutants, and aeroallergens are all implicated in worsening pediatric asthma symptoms, but their relative contributions to asthma exacerbations are poorly understood. A significant decrease in asthma exacerbations has been observed during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, providing a unique opportunity to study how major asthma triggers correlate with asthma activity. Objective: To determine whether changes in respiratory viruses, air pollutants, and/or aeroallergens during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic were concomitant with decreased asthma exacerbations. Methods: Health care utilization and respiratory viral testing data between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2020, were extracted from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Care Network's electronic health record. Air pollution and allergen data were extracted from US Environmental Protection Agency public databases and a National Allergy Bureaucertified station, respectively. Pandemic data (2020) were compared with historical data. Results: Recovery of in-person asthma encounters during phased reopening (June 6 to November 15, 2020) was uneven: primary care well and specialty encounters reached 94% and 74% of prepandemic levels, respectively, whereas primary care sick and hospital encounters reached 21% and 40% of prepandemic levels, respectively. During the pandemic, influenza A and influenza B decreased to negligible frequency when compared with prepandemic cases, whereas respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus infections decreased to low (though nonnegligible) prepandemic levels, as well. No changes in air pollution or aeroallergen levels relative to historical observations were noted. Conclusions: Our results suggest that viral respiratory infections are a primary driver of pediatric asthma exacerbations. These findings have broad relevance to both clinical practice and the development of health policies aimed at reducing asthma morbidity.

104,"Retrospective study of the use of an influenza disease two-tiered classification system to characterize clinical severity in US children In children <5 years, influenza is associated with higher risk of serious disease and hospitalization when compared with other age groups. Influenza vaccination reduces the risk of influenza and vaccination may attenuate the severity of disease. Recent studies in Europe suggest that classifying influenza disease as mild versus moderate-to-severe (M-S) using a novel definition may be clinically significant. We retrospectively evaluated whether this M-S definition also characterized influenza severity in a cohort of US children. We included children <18 years at Kaiser Permanente Northern California with PCR-confirmed influenza during the 20132014 influenza season. We classified children as M-S if they had 1 symptom: fever >39C, acute otitis media, lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), or extra-pulmonary complications; otherwise, they were classified as mild. We used multivariable log-binomial models to assess whether M-S influenza disease was associated with increased healthcare utilization. Nearly half of the 1,105 influenza positive children were classified as M-S. Children 635 months had the highest proportion of M-S disease (35.1%), mostly due to LRTI (63.2%) and fever (44.6%). Children 6 months who had M-S disease were associated with a 1.6 to 2.8 times increased likelihood of having had an emergency department or any follow-up outpatient visits. Those who had M-S disease were associated with an increased likelihood of receiving antibiotics, with the highest likelihood in children 635 months (RR 9.0, 95% CI 4.1, 19.8). While more studies are needed, an influenza classification system may distinguish children with more clinically significant disease.

105,"The potential impact of palivizumab on pediatric airway reconstruction Purpose: To examine the role of palivizumab, a monoclonal antibody vaccine designed to prevent respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, in the surgical setting, and to explore the feasibility, in terms of medical benefit and cost, of its use in pediatric airway reconstruction patients. Materials and methods: Literature review of MEDLINE database using the following indexing terms (""respiratory syncytial virus,"" ""palivizumab,"" ""laryngotracheal reconstruction,"" and ""cricotracheal reconstruction"") and limited to following subcategories (English language, postoperative complication, and morbidity and mortality). All phase IV clinical trials reporting data regarding safety, efficacy, and application of palivizumab in the general pediatric population were selected, as well as all studies from any surgical specialty with data on postoperative outcome complicated by RSV infection. Results: The literature demonstrates significant postoperative morbidity and mortality attributable to RSV infection within several surgical specialties including otolaryngology. Meta-analysis of the data from phase IV clinical trials suggests potential benefit from the perioperative use of palivizumab. The cost of vaccination is the principal limiting factor preventing its more widespread application. Conclusion: Otolaryngologists need to be aware of the potential significant morbidity caused by perioperative RSV infection and should consider the prophylactic use of palivizumab in their pediatric airway reconstruction patients in high-risk seasons. A large multicenter study would be required to adequately perform a cost-benefit analysis of palivizumab use for this specific indication.  2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

106,"Leukotriene receptor antagonists in virus-induced wheezing: Evidence to date Virus-induced wheezing is a relatively benign entity that is usually transient in early childhood but is responsible for much health care utilization. The condition, seen traditionally as a subset of those children diagnosed as having frequent episodic asthma, is often treated with inhaled corticosteroids, despite their lack of efficacy. However, there remains some confusion differentiating atopic asthma from virus-induced wheezing in young children and their respective treatment strategies. The demonstration of cysteinyl leukotrienes in the nasopharyngeal secretions of infants and young children who wheeze prompted investigation of the role of leukotriene receptor antagonists in the treatment of virus-induced wheezing for young children with bronchiolitis and virus-induced wheezing. Montelukast, the only leukotriene receptor antagonist studied in young children, has been proven useful in increasing the number of symptom-free days and delaying the recurrence of wheeze in the month following a diagnosis of respiratory syncytial virus-induced wheezing in children aged 3-36 months. Subsequently, in children aged 2-5 years with frequent episodic asthma, primarily involving viral induced attacks in this age group, regular therapy with daily montelukast for 12 months reduced the rate of asthma exacerbations by 31% over placebo, delayed the time to the first exacerbation by 2 months, and lowered the need to prescribe inhaled corticosteroids as preventative therapy. Additionally, montelukast has been demonstrated to be efficacious as an acute episode modifier in children aged 2-14 years (85% children <6 years) with virus-induced wheezing where it was prescribed at the onset of a viral infection in children with an established pattern of viral induced episodes of wheeze in the preceding year. In this study, emergency department visits were reduced by 45%, visits to all health care practitioners were reduced by 23%, and time of preschool/school and parental time off work was reduced by 33% for children who took montelukast for a median of 10 days. At present, there is good evidence to support the use of bronchodilators in the acute treatment of virus-induced wheezing, and increasing evidence to support the use of leukotriene receptor antagonists, in particular montelukast, in the management of children with virus-induced wheezing.  2006 Adis Data Information BV.

107,"Modelling estimates of age-specific influenza-related hospitalisation and mortality in the United Kingdom BACKGROUND: Influenza is rarely confirmed with laboratory testing and accurate assessment of the overall burden of influenza is difficult. We used statistical modelling methods to generate updated, granular estimates of the number/rate of influenza-attributable hospitalisations and deaths in the United Kingdom. Such data are needed on a continuing basis to inform on cost-benefit analyses of treatment interventions, including vaccination.METHODS: Weekly age specific data on hospital admissions (1997-2009) and on deaths (1997-2009) were obtained from national databases. Virology reports (1996-2009) of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus detections were provided by Public Health England. We used an expanded set of ICD-codes to estimate the burden of illness attributable to influenza which we refer to as 'respiratory disease broadly defined'. These codes were chosen to optimise the balance between sensitivity and specificity. A multiple linear regression model controlled for respiratory syncytial virus circulation, with stratification by age and the presence of comorbid risk status (conditions associated with severe influenza outcomes).RESULTS: In the United Kingdom there were 28,516 hospitalisations and 7163 deaths estimated to be attributable to influenza respiratory disease in a mean season, with marked variability between seasons. The highest incidence rates of influenza-attributable hospitalisations and deaths were observed in adults aged 75+ years (252/100,000 and 131/100,000 population, respectively). Influenza B hospitalisations were highest among 5-17 year olds (12/100,000 population). Of all estimated influenza respiratory deaths in 75+ year olds, 50 % occurred out of hospital, and 25 % in 50-64 year olds. Rates of hospitalisations and death due to influenza-attributable respiratory disease were increased in adults identified as at-risk.CONCLUSIONS: Our study points to a substantial but highly variable seasonal influenza burden in all age groups, particularly affecting 75+ year olds. Effective influenza prevention or early intervention with anti-viral treatment in this age group may substantially impact the disease burden and associated healthcare costs. The high burden of influenza B hospitalisation among 5-17 year olds supports current United Kingdom vaccine policy to extend quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccination to this age group.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrial.gov, NCT01520935.

108,"Recombinant human deoxyribonuclease treatment in hospital management of infants with moderate-severe bronchiolitis Bronchiolitis is the main cause of respiratory insufficiency in infants, characterized by acute inflammation, edema, necrosis of epithelial cells and increased mucus production. Mucus is mainly purulent and consequently rich in DNA, as derived from nuclei of degenerating neutrophils and epithelial debris. The treatment is mainly supportive; bronchodilators and systemic steroids are often used but do not reduce the length of hospital stay. The aim of our study is to evaluate the efficacy of recombinant human DNase (rhDNase), in infants affected by moderate-severe bronchiolitis. In a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study, twenty-two infants (12 males) under 6 months of age (median age 1.6 months) were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive either nebulized rhDNase or placebo (saline) at a dose of 2.5 ml once a day for three days. All infants were evaluated, based on a clinical assessment score, on admission and four times daily during the hospitalization. Placebo and study groups were sex- and age-matched and were similar in terms of clinical severity on admission. No differences were observed between the two groups of patients with regard to the length of hospitalization and clinical score during the days observed. Two out of four infants, all in the study group, presenting atelectasis on chest radiographs, showed a rapid improvement on the first day. RhDNase is not an effective routine therapy in treating infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis and it is not useful in preventing severe forms of the disease. On the contrary, it may be an effective, safe and cost-benefit treatment only in infants with bronchiolitis and massive atelectasis. Copyright  by BIOLIFE, s.a.s.

109,"Bovine respiratory syncytial virus outbreak reduced bulls' weight gain and feed conversion for eight months in a Norwegian beef herd BACKGROUND: Cost-benefit evaluation of measures against respiratory disease in cattle requires accounting with the associated production losses. Investigations of naturally occurring respiratory infections in a herd setting are an opportunity for accurate estimates of the consequences. This article presents estimates based on individual monitoring of weight and concentrate intake of several hundred bulls previous to, during and after a respiratory infection outbreak with bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) as the main pathogen. The aim of the study was to analyse the association between exposure to BRSV, weight gain and feed conversion rate, quantify any change in these parameters, and estimate the duration of the change in production.RESULTS: A comparison of growth curves for the bulls that were present during the outbreak revealed that bulls with severe clinical signs had a clear and consistent trend of poorer growth rate than those with milder or no signs. The weight/age-ratio was 0.04-0.10 lower in the severely affected bulls, and evident throughout the study period of 8 months. A comparison of growth rates between apparently healthy bulls being present during the outbreak and a comparable group of bulls exactly 1 year later (n = 377) showed a reduced growth rate of 111 g/day in the first group. The difference amounted to 23 extra days needed to reach the reference weight. Feed conversion was also reduced by 79 g weight gain/kilogram concentrate consumed in the outbreak year.CONCLUSION: This study indicates significant negative effects on performance of animals that develop severe clinical signs in the acute stage, and that the growth and production is negatively affected many months after apparent recovery. In addition, the performance of apparently healthy animals that are exposed during an outbreak are severely negatively affected. The duration of this decrease in production in animals after recovery, or animals that have not shown disease at all, has not previously been documented. These losses will easily be underestimated, but contribute significantly to the costs for the producer. The findings emphasize the importance of BRSV infection for profitability and animal welfare in cattle husbandry. The study also illustrates that utilising intra-herd comparison of health and production parameters is a productive approach to estimate consequences of an outbreak.

110,"Direct cost analyses of palivizumab treatment in a cohort of at-risk children: Evidence from the North Carolina Medicaid Program Objective. Use of palivizumab prophylactic therapy reduces the occurrence of hospitalizations for serious respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract infections in at-risk infants. The direct cost-benefit of palivizumab prophylaxis for infants who are born at 32 to 35 weeks' estimated gestational age (EGA) during their first year of life has not been systematically examined. The objective of this study was to compare the direct costs of palivizumab prophylaxis and RSV treatment in infants who were born at 32 to 35 weeks EGA and received and did not receive palivizumab. Methods. A cohort study was performed of infants who were younger than 1 year and were enrolled in an enhanced primary care case management model within the North Carolina Medicaid Program. Comparisons were made between infants who received (Synagis prophylaxis group) and did not receive palivizumab (nonprophylaxis group) during the study period. Cost was examined using the sum of Medicaid paid services for prophylaxis with palivizumab and treatment for RSV infections that occurred between October 1, 2002, and May 31, 2003. The Anderson framework was used to specify the regression cost models to compare the participants who received (Synagis prophylaxis) and did not receive (nonprophylaxis group) palivizumab. The primary outcomes were actual 7-month seasonal costs and standardized seasonal costs adjusting for the varied months of infant participation. Results. The study sample included 185 Synagis prophylaxis and 182 nonprophylaxis participants who met the inclusion criteria. The average per-person total cost of RSV care and prophylaxis was $5117 for the Synagis prophylaxis group and $371 for the nonprophylaxis group. Five hospitalizations occurred in the prophylaxis group, and 12 occurred in the nonprophylaxis group (odds ratio: 0.27). No deaths occurred in either group. Conclusions. Palivizumab administered to infants who were born at 32 to 35 weeks' EGA did not provide direct cost savings related to hospitalization or ambulatory care in a Medicaid population. The primary difference in cost between the groups was attributable to the palivizumab prophylaxis. Copyright  2004 by the American Academy of Pediatrics. (Wegner S., sew@ncaccesscare.org; Vann J.J.)

111,"Restricted Palivizumab Recommendations and the Impact on RSV Hospitalizations among Infants Born at > 29 Weeks of Gestational Age: An Italian Multicenter Study Objective: Premature infants have the highest risk of being hospitalized with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections. Palivizumab is the only licensed agent for RSVhospitalization (RSVH) prophylaxis in infants born at < 35 weeks of gestational age (wGA). In 2016, the Italian Drug Agency (Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco [AIFA]) has restricted the eligibility for reimbursement to infants at high risk of RSVH, ruling out palivizumab administration for infants born at > 29 wGA. The aim of the present study was to compare the incidence of RSVH in two consecutive epidemic seasons (2015-2016 vs. 2016-2017), that is, before and after the new AIFA recommendations on palivizumab eligibility. Study Design; This was a noninterventional retrospective cohort study conducted at three neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in northern Italy. Infants born at 29 and 35 wGA between March 15, 2015 and March 14, 2017 were enrolled for this study. Electronic medical charts were reviewed and parents were interviewed by telephone. Data were collected on neonatal course during NICU stay, palivizumab administration, and hospitalizations related to respiratory infections during the 1st year of life, comparing the infants born in season 1 with season 2. Results: Of 632 eligible infants, data were available for 536 (262 in season 1 and 274 in season 2). Overall, RSVH occurred 1.9 and 5.1% in infants in seasons 1 and 2, respectively (odds ratio [OR] = 2.77; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.98-7.8, p = 0.045). When the analysis was limited to patients not exposed to palivizumab, RSVHs were recorded for 1.8 and 5.9% infants in seasons 1 and 2, respectively (OR = 3.42; 95% CI: 0.96-12.20, p = 0.045). It is noteworthy that the incidence of hospital admissions for respiratory viruses other than RSV did not differ between the two seasons. Conclusion: Restricting eligibility for palivizumab reimbursement led to a significant increase in RSVH but had no impact on hospitalizations for other respiratory viruses. Future decisions on palivizumab prescription and coverage rules should be driven by a careful assessment of the cost-benefit ratio. (Priante E.; Mardegan V.; Baraldi E.)

112,"Differences in antibiotic and antiviral use in people with confirmed influenza: a retrospective comparison of rapid influenza PCR and multiplex respiratory virus PCR tests Background: Influenza is a highly contagious respiratory virus with clinical impacts on patient morbidity, mortality and hospital bed management. The effect of rapid nucleic acid testing (RPCR) in comparison to standard multiplex PCR (MPCR) diagnosis in treatment decisions is unclear. This study aimed to determine whether RPCR influenza testing in comparison to standard MPCR testing was associated with differences in antibiotic and antiviral (oseltamivir) utilisation and hospital length of stay in emergency department and inpatient hospital settings. Methods: A retrospective cohort study of positive influenza RPCR and MPCR patients was performed utilising data from the 2017 influenza season. Medical records of correlating patient presentations were reviewed for data collection. An analysis of RPCR versus MPCR patient outcomes was performed examining test turnaround time, antibiotic initiation, oseltamivir initiation and hospital length of stay for both emergency department and inpatient hospital stay. Subgroup analysis was performed to assess oseltamivir use in high risk populations for influenza complications. Statistical significance was assessed using Mann-Whitney test for numerical data and Chi-squared test for categorical data. Odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals were calculated where appropriate. Results: Overall, 122 RPCR and 362 MPCR positive influenza patients were included in this study. Commencement of antibiotics was less frequent in the RPCR than MPCR cohorts (51% vs 67%; p < 0.01, OR 0.52; 95% CI 0.340.79). People at high risk of complications from influenza who were tested with the RPCR were more likely to be treated with oseltamivir compared to those tested with the MPCR (76% vs 63%; p = 0.03, OR 1.81; 95% CI 1.073.08). Hospital length of stay was not impacted when either test was used in the emergency department and inpatient settings. Conclusions: These findings suggest utilisation of RPCR testing in influenza management can improve antibiotic stewardship through reduction in antibiotic use and improvement in oseltamivir initiation in those at higher risk of complications. Further research is required to determine other factors that may have influenced hospital length of stay and a cost-benefit analysis should be undertaken to determine the financial impact of the RPCR test.

Of the 4,329 articles retrieved from the data-bases, 89 studies that met the inclusion criteria were from 39 different countries with appar-ently healthy individuals and patients with acute respiratory infections, acute flaccid myelitis and asthma-related diseases. The CFR estimate revealed occasional deaths (7/1353) related to EV-D68 infections in patients with severe acute respiratory infections. Analyses showed that the combined prevalence of current and past EV-D68 infections was 4% (95% CI = 3.15.0) and 66.3% (95% CI = 40.088.2), respectively. The highest prevalences were in hospital outbreaks, developed countries, children under 5, after 2014, and in patients with acute flaccid myelitis and asthma-related diseases. The present study shows sporadic deaths linked to severe respiratory EV-D68 infections. The study also highlights a low prevalence of current EV-D68 infections as opposed to the existence of EV-D68 antibodies in almost all participants of the included studies. These findings therefore highlight the need to implement and/or strengthen continuous surveillance of EV-D68 infections in hospitals and in the community for the anticipation of the response to future epidemics.

114,"Case fatality proportions and predictive factors for mortality among children hospitalized with severe pneumonia in a rural developing country setting Few large studies have evaluated risk factors for mortality among children hospitalized for pneumonia and this may contribute to suboptimal case management efficiency. To identify useful screening criteria for mortality among children hospitalized for pneumonia in a developing country setting, we conducted a population-based hospital cohort study among children less than 2 years of age admitted for pneumonia during 1999-2001 at one of three major hospitals on Lombok Island, Indonesia. Of 4351 children admitted for pneumonia, 12 per cent died before discharge. Case fatality proportions were seasonal, with peaks occurring immediately after peaks in the proportion of cases positive for respiratory syncytial virus. Children with an oxygen saturation  85 per cent or age younger than 4 months were 5.6 times more likely to die than children with none of these predictive factors (95 per cent CI, 4.5-7.1); 83 per cent of children who died had one of these two risk factors. For children < 4 months old, mortality increased at an oxygen saturation < 88 per cent compared with < 80 per cent for older children. Laboratory, physical examination, and radiological findings were not associated with or did not contribute substantially to mortality prediction. Among children hospitalized for pneumonia, age less than 4 months and hypoxia were identified with those at high risk of death. Age influences cut-off levels for hypoxia.

115,"Case fatality rate and viral aetiologies of acute respiratory tract infections in HIV positive and negative people in Africa: The VARIAFRICA-HIV systematic review and meta-analysis Background: To set priorities for efficient control of acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) in Africa, it is necessary to have accurate estimate of its burden, especially among HIV-infected populations. Objectives: To compare case fatality rate (CFR) and viral aetiologies of ARTI between HIV-positive and HIV-negative populations in Africa. Study design: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Knowledge, Africa Journal Online, and Global Index Medicus to identify studies published from January 2000 to April 2018. Random-effect meta-analysis method was used to assess association (pooled weighted odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI)). Results: A total of 36 studies (126,526 participants) were included. CFR was significantly higher in patients with HIV than in HIV-negative controls (OR 4.10, 95%CI: 2.636.27, I2: 93.7%). The risk was significantly higher among children 5 years (OR 5.51, 95%CI 2.8310.74) compared to people aged >5 years (OR 1.48, 95%CI 1.171.89); p = 0.0002. There was no difference between children (15 years) and adults and between regions of Africa. There was no difference for viral respiratory aetiologies (Enterovirus, Adenovirus, Bocavirus, Coronavirus, Metapneumovirus, Parainfluenza, Influenza, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus) of ARTI between HIV-positive and HIV-negative people, except for Rhinovirus where being HIV-negative was associated with Rhinovirus (OR 0.70; 95%CI 0.510.97, I2: 63.4%). Conclusions: This study shows an increased risk of deaths among HIV-infected individuals with ARTI, however with no difference in viral aetiologies compared to HIV-negative individuals in Africa. ARTI deserves more attention from HIV health-care providers for efficient control. Specific strategies are needed for HIV-positive children under 5.

116,"Cost-effectiveness of Palivizumab for Respiratory Syncytial Virus: A systematic review CONTEXT: Palivizumab prophylaxis is used as passive immunization for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). However, because of its high cost, the value of this intervention is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the cost-effectiveness of palivizumab prophylaxis compared with no prophylaxis in infants,24 months of age. DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library up to August 2018. STUDY SELECTION: Two reviewers independently screened results to include economic evaluations conducted between 2000 and 2018 from Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers independently extracted outcomes. Quality appraisal was completed by using the Joanna Briggs Institute checklist. Costs were adjusted to 2017 US dollars. RESULTS: We identified 28 economic evaluations (20 cost-utility analyses and 8 cost-effectiveness analyses); most were from the United States (n = 6) and Canada (n = 5). Study quality was high; 23 studies met .80% of the Joanna Briggs Institute criteria. Palivizumab prophylaxis ranged from a dominant strategy to having an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $2 526 203 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) depending on study perspective and targeted population. From the payer perspective, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for preterm infants (2935 weeks gestational age) was between $5188 and $791 265 per QALY, with 90% of estimates,$50 000 per QALY. Influential parameters were RSV hospitalization reduction rates, palivizumab cost, and discount rate. LIMITATIONS: Model design heterogeneity, model parameters, and study settings were barriers to definitive conclusions on palivizumabs economic value. CONCLUSIONS: Palivizumab as RSV prophylaxis was considered cost-effective in prematurely born infants, infants with lung complications, and infants from remote communities.

117,"Should we use Palivizumab immunoprophylaxis for infants against respiratory syncytial virus? - A cost-utility analysis Background: Passive immunization against RSV (Respiratory Syncytial Virus) is given in most western countries (including Israel) to infants of high risk groups such as premature babies, and infants with Congenital Heart Disease or Congenital Lung Disease. However, immunoprophylaxis costs are extremely high ($2800-$4200 per infant). Using cost-utility analysis criteria, we evaluate whether it is justified to expand, continue or restrict nationwide immunoprophylaxis using palivizumab of high risk infants against RSV. Methods: Epidemiological, demographic, health service utilisation and economic data were integrated from primary (National Hospitalization Data, etc.) and secondary data sources (ie: from published articles) into a spread-sheet to calculate the cost per averted disability-adjusted life year (DALY) of vaccinating various infant risk groups. Costs of intervention included antibody plus administration costs. Treatment savings and DALYs averted were estimated from applying vaccine efficacy data to relative risks of being hospitalised and treated for RSV, including possible long-term sequelae like asthma and wheezing. Results: For all the groups RSV immunoprophylaxis is clearly not cost effective as its cost per averted DALY exceeds the $105,986 guideline representing thrice the per capita Gross Domestic Product. Vaccine price would have to fall by 48.1% in order to justify vaccinating Congenital Heart Disease or Congenital Lung Disease risk groups respectively on pure cost-effectiveness grounds. For premature babies of < 29 weeks, 29-32 and 33-36 weeks gestation, decreases of 36.8%, 54.5% and 83.3% respectively in vaccine price are required. Conclusions: Based solely on cost-utility analysis, at current price levels it is difficult to justify the current indications for passive vaccination with Palivizumab against RSV. However, if the manufacturers would reduce the price by 54.5% then it would be cost-effective to vaccinate the Congenital Heart Disease or Congenital Lung Disease risk groups as well as premature babies born before the 33rd week of gestation.

118,"A cost-effectiveness analysis of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) prophylaxis in infants in the United Kingdom Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common cause of respiratory infection that is highly prevalent in infants. Severe cases of RSV infection require hospitalisation; this is most likely to occur in infant populations at high risk. The study assesses the cost-effectiveness of palivizumab versus no prophylaxis in infants at high risk of hospitalisation with RSV in the United Kingdom (UK). Methods: A decision tree model was developed to reflect the clinical pathway of infants at high risk of severe RSV infection who receive either prophylaxis with palivizumab or no prophylaxis. The main outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the degree of uncertainty surrounding the results. A threshold analysis considered the impact of clinical and environmental risk factors on the cost-effectiveness in the subgroup of preterm infants 33-35 weeks gestational age (wGA). Results: Prophylaxis with palivizumab compared with no prophylaxis is associated with the following ICERs; 33,216 for infants with congenital heart disease; 19,168 for infants with chronic lung disease; 3,845 for preterm infants < 29 wGA; 30,205 for preterm infants 29-32 wGA; and 99,056 for preterm infants 33-35 wGA. One-way sensitivity analysis suggests that these results are highly sensitive to the input data. Threshold analysis in the preterm 33-35 wGA subgroup demonstrates that an adjusted RSV-hospitalisation baseline risk of 17.94% or higher would result in an ICER below the 30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year threshold. Discussion: Palivizumab is cost-effective compared to no prophylaxis in the United Kingdom in many of the subgroups considered, showing that palivizumab would be a cost-effective use of National Health Service resources.  2013 Bentley et al.

119,"Cost-effectiveness of respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis with palivizumab Background: A monoclonal antibody, palivizumab, directed against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has been shown to decrease hospitalisation rates. Because of its expense, the cost-effectiveness of this agent should be determined for high-risk groups. Aim: To determine characteristics of RSV infection in Townsville and the economic feasibility of palivizumab immunoprophylaxis in high-risk groups. Methods: Cases of RSV-positive bronchiolitis were retrospectively identified. Cases were grouped according to recognised risk factors. The hypothetical costs of palivizumab immunoprophylaxis for infants at risk were calculated. Results: The rate of hospitalisation with RSV-positive lower respiratory tract infection was 22 per 1000 live births but increased to 50 per 1000 among Indigenous babies born weighing <2500 g. The cost of preventing an admission in each of the identified high-risk groups, based on drug costs alone, ranged from A$69 861 to A$88 547.

120,"Cost-effectiveness of respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis in various indications Objectives: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of immunoprophylaxis against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections with palivizumab based on actual cost and observed incidence rates in various pediatric risk groups. Design: Decision tree analysis comparing children with various combinations of the following indications: chronic lung disease, congenital heart disease, or prematurity (32 weeks gestation), and children with none of these indications. One-way sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo simulations were used to quantify parameter uncertainty. Setting: Florida during the 2004-2005 RSV season. Participants: A total of 159 790 Medicaid-eligible children aged 0 to 2 years. Intervention: Palivizumab prophylaxis compared with no prophylaxis. Outcomes Measure: Incremental cost (2010 US dollars) per hospitalization for RSV infection avoided. Results: The mean cost of palivizumab per dose ranged from $1661 for infants younger than 6 months of age to $2584 for children in their second year of life. Among preterm infants younger than 6 months of age without other indications, immunoprophylaxis with palivizumab cost $302 103 (95% confidence interval, $141 850-$914 798) to prevent 1 RSV-related hospitalization. Given amean cost of $8910 for 1 RSV-related hospitalization in this subgroup, palivizumab would be cost-neutral at a per-dose cost of $47. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for the other subgroups ranged from $361 727 to more than $1.3 million per RSV-related hospitalization avoided in children up to 2 years of age with chronic lung disease and no additional risk factors. Younger age and multiple indications were associated with improvements in the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Conclusions: The cost of immunoprophylaxis with palivizumab far exceeded the economic benefit of preventing hospitalizations, even in infants at highest risk for RSV infection. 2011 American Medical Association.

121,"Cost-utility analysis of palivizumab in Italy: Results from a simulation model in the prophylaxis of respiratory syncytial virus infection (RSV) among high-risk preterm infants Introduction: The aim of this study was to assess the cost-utility of palivizumab versus no prophylaxis in the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus infection among high-risk preterm infants. Methods: We used and adapted a pre-existent model in which two cohorts of patients received palivizumab or no prophylaxis. The patients were followed for their expected lifetimes. The economic evaluation was conducted from the perspective of the Italian National Health Service. We considered Life-Years Gained (LYGs), Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs) and direct medical costs (pharmacological treatment, hospitalization, recurrences for wheezing, etc.). LYGs and QALYs were based on the results of a double blind cohort study with prospective follow-up and direct medical costs were based on Italian treatment patterns. Benefits and costs were discounted at 3%. Costs were assessed in 2007 Euros. Sensitivity and threshold analysis on key clinical and economic parameters were performed. Result: For the two cohorts, the expected life-years (per patient) with palivizumab versus no prophylaxis were 29.842 and 29.754 years, respectively. Quality-adjusted life years (per patient) with palivizumab were 29.202, and for no prophylaxis were 29.043. The expected cost (per patient) was  6,244.20 with palivizumab and  4,867.70 with no prophylaxis. We calculated for palivizumab versus no prophylaxis the incremental cost per LYG and per QALY gained. It was  15,568.65 and  8,676.74, respectively. Conclusion: This study suggests that, compared with no prophylaxis, palivizumab is cost-effective in the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus infection among high risk preterm infants.  2009 Chirico et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

122,"Passive immunisation against respiratory syncytial virus: A cost-effectiveness analysis Aim: The cost-effectiveness of passive immunisation against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in the Netherlands was studied by assessing incremental costs to prevent one hospitalisation in high-risk children using a novel individualised monthly approach. Methods: Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed by combining estimates of individual hospitalisation costs and monthly hospitalisation risks, with immunisation costs, parental costs and efficacy of passive immunisation for a reference case with the highest hospitalisation risks and costs of hospitalisation during the RSV season (male, gestational age 28 weeks, birth weight 2500 g, having bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), aged 0 months at the beginning of the season (October)). Various sensitivity analyses and a cost-neutrality analysis were performed. Results: Cost-effectiveness of passive immunisation varied widely by child characteristics and seasonal month. For the reference case it was most cost effective in December at 13 190 per hospitalisation averted. Cost-effectiveness was most sensitive to changes in hospitalisation risk. For the reference case, cost neutrality was reached in December, if acquisition costs of passive immunisation decreased from 930 to 375, monthly hospitalisation risk increased from 7.6% to 17%, or hospitalisation costs increased from 10 250 to 23 250 per hospitalisation. Even if passive immunisation prevented all hospitalisations, costs per hospitalisation averted in December would still exceed 2645. Conclusions: Although cost-effectiveness of passive immunisation varied strongly by child characteristics and seasonal month, incremental costs per hospitalisation averted were always high. A restrictive immunisation policy only immunising children with BPD in high-risk months is therefore recommended. The costs of passive immunisation would have to be considerably reduced to achieve cost-effectiveness.

123,"Cost-effectiveness of rule-based immunoprophylaxis against respiratory syncytial virus infections in preterm infants The objective of the paper is to assess the cost-effectiveness of targeted respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) prophylaxis based on a validated prediction rule with 1-year time horizon in moderately preterm infants compared to no prophylaxis. Data on health care consumption were derived from a randomised clinical trial on wheeze reduction following RSV prophylaxis and a large birth cohort study on risk prediction of RSV hospitalisation. We calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of targeted RSV prophylaxis vs. no prophylaxis per quality-adjusted life year (QALYs) using a societal perspective, including medical and parental costs and effects. Costs and health outcomes were modelled in a decision tree analysis with sensitivity analyses. Targeted RSV prophylaxis in infants with a first-year RSV hospitalisation risk of > 10% resulted in a QALY gain of 0.02 (0.931 vs. 0.929) per patient against additional cost of 472 compared to no prophylaxis (ICER 214,748/QALY). The ICER falls below a threshold of 80,000 per QALY when RSV prophylaxis cost would be lowered from 928 (baseline) to 406 per unit. At a unit cost of 97, RSV prophylaxis would be cost saving. Conclusions: Targeted RSV prophylaxis is not cost-effective in reducing RSV burden of disease in moderately preterm infants, but it can become cost-effective if lower priced biosimilar palivizumab or a vaccine would be available.

124,"Impact and cost-effectiveness of strategies to prevent respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease in Vietnam: A modelling study Background: New prevention strategies for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are emerging, but it is unclear if they will be cost-effective in low- and middle-income countries. We evaluated the potential impact and cost-effectiveness of two strategies to prevent RSV disease in young children in Vietnam. Methods: We used a static cohort model with a finely disaggregated age structure (weeks of age <5 years) to calculate the RSV disease burden in Vietnam, with and without a single dose of maternal vaccine (RSVpreF, Pfizer) or of monoclonal antibody (Nirsevimab, Sanofi, Astra Zeneca). Each strategy was compared to no pharmaceutical intervention, and to each other. We assumed both strategies would be administered year round over a ten-year period. The primary outcome measure was the cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted, from a societal perspective. We ran probabilistic and deterministic uncertainty analyses. Results: With central input assumptions for RSVpreF vaccine ($25/dose, 69 % efficacy, 6 months protection) and Nirsevimab ($25/dose, 77 % efficacy, 5 months protection), both options had similar cost-effectiveness ($3442 versus $3367 per DALY averted) when compared separately to no pharmaceutical intervention. RSVpreF vaccine had a lower net cost than Nirsevimab (net discounted cost of $213 m versus $264 m) but prevented fewer RSV deaths (24 % versus 31 %). Our results were very sensitive to assumptions about the dose price, efficacy, and duration of protection. At $5/dose and a willingness-to-pay threshold of 0.5 times the national GDP per capita, both prevention strategies have the potential to be cost-effective. Conclusions: RSVpreF vaccine and Nirsevimab may be cost-effective in Vietnam if appropriately priced. (Do L.A.H., lienanhha.do@mcri.edu.au; Mulholland K.)

125,"Cost-effectiveness analysis of palivizumab as respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis in preterm infants in Sweden Aim: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of palivizumab vs. no prophylaxis for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in preterm infants in Sweden. Methods: A probabilistic Markov model was populated using a nationwide register linkage and data from the literature. Cost-effectiveness was investigated from a societal perspective over a lifetime for infants born at <29 weeks of gestation. Palivizumab was modelled using assumptions for its direct effect on RSV hospitalization risk and an indirect effect (via decreased RSV hospitalization) on subsequent asthma and mortality during the epidemic. Costs and effects were discounted by 3%. Results: In the base case, prophylaxis resulted in an additional 0.102 quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) at a cost of 20 000 SEK relative to no prophylaxis (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER] 195 000 SEK/QALY). The probability of prophylaxis being cost-effective was 99% at a willingness-to-pay of 500 000 SEK/QALY. Assumptions about a causal association between RSV infection and subsequent asthma had a moderate impact, while exclusion of the indirect prophylaxis effect on mortality increased the ICER to 492 000 SEK/QALY. When excluding both of these, prophylaxis was not cost-effective. Conclusion: Based on a willingness-to-pay of 500 000 SEK/QALY, palivizumab was found to be cost-effective compared with no prophylaxis for infants born at <29 weeks if severe RSV infection was assumed to increase subsequent asthma or mortality risk.  2011 Foundation Acta Pdiatrica.

126,"Cost-effectiveness of potential infant vaccination against respiratory syncytial virus infection in The Netherlands Introduction: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is one of the major causes of respiratory illness in infants, infecting virtually every child before the age of 2 years. Currently, several Phase 1 trials with RSV vaccines in infants are ongoing or have been completed. As yet, no efficacy estimates are available for these vaccine candidates. Nevertheless, cost-effectiveness estimates might be informative to enable preliminary positioning of an RSV vaccine. Methods: A decision analysis model was developed in which a Dutch birth cohort was followed for 12 months. A number of potential vaccination strategies were reviewed such as vaccination at specific ages, a two- or three-dosing scheme and seasonal vaccination versus year-round vaccination. The impact of the assumptions made was explored in various sensitivity analyses, including probabilistic analysis. Outcome measures included the number of GP visits, hospitalizations and deaths, costs, quality-adjusted life years and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Results: Currently, without vaccination, an annual number of 28,738 of RSV-related GP visits, 1623 hospitalizations, and 4.5 deaths are estimated in children in the age of 0-1 year. The total annual cost to society of RSV in the non-vaccination scenario is 7.7 million (95%CI: 1.7-16.7) and the annual disease burden is estimated at 597 QALYs (95%CI: 133-1319). In case all infants would be offered a potentially safe and effective 3-dose RSV vaccination scheme at the age of 0, 1 and 3 months, the total annual net costs were estimated to increase to 21.2 million, but 544 hospitalizations and 1.5 deaths would be averted. The ICER was estimated at 34,142 (95%CI:  21,652- 87,766) per QALY gained. A reduced dose schedule, seasonal vaccination, and consideration of out-of-pocket expenses all resulted in more favorable ICER values, whereas a reduced vaccine efficacy or a delay in the timing of vaccination resulted in less favorable ICERs. Discussion: Our model used recently updated estimates on the burden of RSV disease in children and it included plausible utilities. However, due to the absence of clinical trial data, a number of crucial assumptions had to be made related to the characteristics of potential RSV vaccine. The outcomes of our modeling exercise show that vaccination of infants against RSV might be cost-effective. However, clinical trial data are warranted.  2012 Elsevier Ltd.

127,"Cost-Effectiveness of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Preventive Interventions in Children: A Model Comparison Study Objectives: Model-based cost-effectiveness analyses on maternal vaccine (MV) and monoclonal antibody (mAb) interventions against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) use context-specific data and produce varied results. Through model comparison, we aim to characterize RSV cost-effectiveness models and examine drivers for their outputs. Methods: We compared 3 static and 2 dynamic models using a common input parameter set for a hypothetical birth cohort of 100 000 infants. Year-round and seasonal programs were evaluated for MV and mAb interventions, using available evidence during the study period (eg, phase III MV and phase IIb mAb efficacy). Results: Three static models estimated comparable medically attended (MA) cases averted versus no intervention (MV, 1019-1073; mAb, 5075-5487), with the year-round MV directly saving 1 million medical and 0.3 million nonmedical costs, while gaining 4 to 5 discounted quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) annually in <1-year-olds, and mAb resulting in 4 million medical and 1.5 million nonmedical cost savings, and 21 to 25 discounted QALYs gained. In contrast, both dynamic models estimated fewer MA cases averted (MV, 402-752; mAb, 3362-4622); one showed an age shift of RSV cases, whereas the other one reported many non-MA symptomatic cases averted, especially by MV (2014). These differences can be explained by model types, assumptions on non-MA burden, and interventions effectiveness over time. Conclusions: Our static and dynamic models produced overall similar hospitalization and death estimates, but also important differences, especially in non-MA cases averted. Despite the small QALY decrement per non-MA case, their larger number makes them influential for the costs per QALY gained of RSV interventions.

128,"Cost-effectiveness of monoclonal antibody and maternal immunization against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in infants: Evaluation for six European countries Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) imposes a substantial burden on pediatric hospital capacity in Europe. Promising prophylactic interventions against RSV including monoclonal antibodies (mAb) and maternal immunizations (MI) are close to licensure. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of potential mAb and MI interventions against RSV in infants, for six European countries. Methods: We used a static cohort model to compare costs and health effects of four intervention programs to no program and to each other: year-round MI, year-round mAb, seasonal mAb (October to April), and seasonal mAb plus a catch-up program in October. Input parameters were obtained from national registries and literature. Influential input parameters were identified with the expected value of partial perfect information and extensive scenario analyses (including the impact of interventions on wheezing and asthma). Results: From the health care payer perspective, and at a price of 50 per dose (mAb and MI), seasonal mAb plus catch-up was cost-saving in Scotland, and cost-effective for willingness-to-pay (WTP) values 20,000 (England, Finland) or 30,000 (Denmark) per quality adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for all scenarios considered, except when using ICD-10 based hospitalization data. For the Netherlands, seasonal mAb was preferred (WTP value: 30,000-90,000) for most scenarios. For Veneto region (Italy), either seasonal mAb with or without catch-up or MI was preferred, depending on the scenario and WTP value. From a full societal perspective (including leisure time lost), the seasonal mAb plus catch-up program was cost-saving for all countries except the Netherlands. Conclusion: The choice between a MI or mAb program depends on the level and duration of protection, price, availability, and feasibility of such programs, which should be based on the latest available evidence. Future research should focus on measuring accurately age-specific RSV-attributable hospitalizations in very young children.

129,"Comparative Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Vaccines for Older Adults in Hong Kong Two respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines (AREXVY() and ABRYSVO()) were recently approved for older adults in the US. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of AREXVY() and ABRYSVO() from the Hong Kong public healthcare providers perspective. A two-year decision-analytical model was developed to examine the outcomes of a single RSV vaccination (AREXVY() or ABRYSVO()) compared to no vaccination. Primary outcomes included RSV-related health outcomes, direct medical costs, quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) loss, and incremental cost per QALY (ICER). RSV vaccines are not yet marketed in Hong Kong, base-case analysis, therefore, benchmarked US RSV vaccine prices at 4 levels (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%). AREXVY() and ABRYSVO() (versus no vaccination) gained 0.000568 QALY and 0.000647 QALY, respectively. ICERs of ABRYSVO() (26,209 USD/QALY) and AREXVY() (47,485 USD/QALY) were lower than the willingness-to-pay threshold (49,594 USD/QALY) at 25% US vaccine price. The RSV attack rate was a common influential factor at all vaccine price levels. The probabilities of AREXVY() and ABRYSVO() to be most cost-effective were 0.10% and 97.68%, respectively, at 25% US vaccine price. Single vaccination of ABRYSVO() or AREXVY() for older adults appears to gain QALYs over 2 years in Hong Kong. The cost-effectiveness of AREXVY() and ABRYSVO() is subject to vaccine price and RSV attack rate.

130,"Cost-utility analysis of Palivizumab for Respiratory Syncytial Virus infection prophylaxis in preterm infants: Update based on the clinical evidence in Spain Background: This study aimed at estimating the efficiency of palivizumab in the prevention of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infection and its sequelae in preterm infants (32(day 1)-35(day 0)weeks of gestational age -wGA-) in Spain. Methods: A decision-tree model was developed to compare health benefits (Quality Adjusted Life Years-QALYs) and costs of palivizumab versus a non-prophylaxis strategy over 6 years. A hypothetical cohort of 1,000 preterm infants, 32(day 1)-35(day 0) wGA (4.356 kg average weight) at the beginning of the prophylaxis (15 mg/kg of palivizumab; 3.88 average number of injections per RSV season) was analysed. The model considered the most recent evidence from Spanish observational and epidemiological studies on RSV infection: the FLIP II study provided hospital admission and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission rates; in-hospital mortality rate was drawn from an epidemiological study from 2004 to 2012; recurrent wheezing rates associated to RSV infection from SPRING study were adjusted by the evidence on the palivizumab effect from clinical trials. Quality of life baseline value, number of hospitalized infants and the presence of recurrent wheezing over time were granted to estimate QALYs. National Health Service and societal perspective (included also recurrent wheezing indirect cost) were analysed. Total costs (, 2016) included pharmaceutical and administration costs, hospitalization costs and recurrent wheezing management annual costs. A discount rate of 3.0% was applied annually for both costs and health outcomes. Results: Over 6 years, the base case analysis showed that palivizumab was associated to an increase of 0.0731 QALYs compared to non-prophylaxis. Total costs were estimated in 2,110.71 (palivizumab) and 671.68 (non-prophylaxis) from the National Health System (NHS) perspective, resulting in an incremental cost utility ratio (ICUR) of 19,697.69/QALYs gained (prophylaxis vs non-prophylaxis). Results derived from the risk-factors population subgroups analysed were in line with the total population results. From the societal perspective, the incremental cost associated to palivizumab decreased to an 1,253.14 (ICUR = 17,153.16/QALYs gained for palivizumab vs non-prophylaxis). One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the model. Conclusions: The prophylaxis with palivizumab is efficient for preventing from RSV infections in preterm infants 32(day 1)-35(day 0) wGA in Spain.

131,"Cost-effectiveness of palivizumab against respiratory syncytial viral infection in high-risk children in Austria Objective: The aim of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of palivizumab, a monoclonal antibody against severe respiratory syncytial virus infection, in high-risk infants in Austria. Methods: A decision tree model was developed to determine cost-effectiveness in infants born prematurely (35 weeks' gestational age), those with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and children with congenital heart disease (CHD). The primary perspective of the analysis was that of the compulsory health insurance fund. The societal perspective was also considered. Results: From the health insurance fund perspective, including the costs associated with asthma, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (cost per qualityadjusted life year [QALY] gained) without discounting was estimated to be 4484 (2006 euros) in preterm infants, 6719 in children with BPD, and 2668 in the CHD population. When discounted, these figures increased to 14,439, 21,672, and 9754, respectively. The results from the societal perspective were substantially more cost-effective in all populations. The undiscounted cost per QALY was 1435 in preterm infants, 4881 in children with BPD, and 251 in the CHD group. Discounted figures were 4623, 15,741, and 917, respectively. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the model, and scenario analyses found that the inclusion of indirect costs led to further improvement in the cost-effectiveness outcomes for palivizumab.

132,"Cost-effectiveness of palivizumab in preventing respiratory syncytial virus in premature infants and children with chronic lung disease in Spain Objectives: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of palivizumab (Synagis) in preventing respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in high risk children in Spain: premature infants (<=35 weeks) and those with chronic lung disease (CLD). Methods: A decision tree model was developed using data from the scientific literature, clinical trials of palivizumab, Spanish population data, and estimates from experts in neonatology. The study was conducted from the perspective of the National Health System (NHS), and includes the costs of administering palivizumab and of health care for infected children. The measures of effectiveness are life years gained (LYG) and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained. Both costs and outcomes are adjusted using a discount rate of 3.5%. Sensitivity analyses are made by modifying the variables related with hospitalization, mortality, discount rate and utility. Results: With the use of palivizumab, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for direct medical costs, including recurrent wheezing, is 13,846/QALY (12,208/QALY for premature infants and 17,620/QALY for CLD). The cost-effectiveness ratio is more favourable (lower ICER) if indirect costs (loss of productivity) are included. The sensitivity analyses are consistent with the findings of the baseline case. Conclusion: Palivizumab is a cost-effective therapy for the protection of high risk infants against RSV. It is efficient from the perspective of the NHS, since the cost of a QALY is much lower than the threshold of 30,000/QALY that is generally considered socially acceptable in Spain and other European countries.  2007 Adis Data Information BV.

133,"Cost-effectiveness of palivizumab for respiratory syncytial virus infection in high-risk children, based on long-term epidemiologic data from Austria Objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness of palivizumab, a monoclonal antibody against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), in infants at high risk for severe RSV lower respiratory tract infection, such as premature infants, infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and those with congenital heart disease, based on long-term epidemiologic data from Austria. Methods: A decision-tree model was used, and the analysis was based on a lifetime follow-up investigating cost-effectiveness of palivizumab versus no RSV infection prevention. The primary perspective of the study was that of the healthcare system, the second that of society. Cost and effects were discounted by 5%. The base case analysis included only direct medical costs, and a scenario analysis included various indirect costs. Results: Analyses were based on epidemiologic data on a total of 1579 children hospitalized because of RSV lower respiratory tract infection during 16 seasons. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the first outcome measure (life years gained) amounted to discounted costs of 34,956 (for all preterm infants), 35,056 (for <33 weeks' gestational age [wGA] infants), 35,233 (for 33-35 wGA infants), 35,611 (for infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia), and 8956 (for infants with congenital heart disease). Use of palivizumab compared with no prophylaxis had an incremental cost-utility ratio of 26,212, 26,292, 24,392, 24,654, and 8484, respectively, per quality-adjusted life years. Results from the society perspective were more cost-effective in all study populations. An additional scenario analysis with 7 injections for the 33 to 35 wGA group revealed cost-effectiveness as well.

135,"Impact of using the International Risk Scoring Tool on the cost-utility of palivizumab for preventing severe respiratory syncytial virus infection in Canadian moderate-to-late preterm infants Background and objective: To assess the cost-utility of palivizumab versus no prophylaxis in preventing severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in Canadian moderate-to-late preterm (3235 weeks gestational age) infants using an (i) International Risk Scoring Tool (IRST) and (ii) Canadian RST (CRST). Methods: A decision tree was developed to assess cost-utility. Infants assessed at moderate- and high-risk of RSV-related hospitalization (RSVH) by the IRST or CRST received palivizumab or no prophylaxis and then progressed to either (i) RSVH; (ii) emergency room/outpatient medically attended RSV-infection (MARI) or (iii) were uninfected/non-medically attended. Infants admitted to intensive care could incur mortality (0.43%). Respiratory morbidity was accounted in all uninfected surviving infants for 6 years or 18 years (RSVH/MARI). Palivizumab efficacy (72.2% RSVH reduction) and hospital outcomes were from the Canadian CARESS, PICNIC and RSV-Quebec studies. Palivizumab costs (50 mg: CAN$752; 100 mg: $1,505) were calculated from Canadian birth statistics combined with a growth algorithm. Healthcare/payer and societal costs (May 2022; 1.5% discounting) were included. Results: Cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) was $29,789 with the IRST (0.79 probability of being <$50,000) and $15,833 with the CRST (0.96 probability). The model was most sensitive to utility scores, long-term sequelae and palivizumab cost. Vial sharing improved the incremental cost-utility ratio (IRST: $22,319; CRST: $9,231). Conclusions: Palivizumab was highly cost-effective (vs no prophylaxis) in Canadian moderate-to-late preterm infants using either the IRST or CRST. The IRST has fewer risk factors than the CRST (3 vs 7, respectively), captures more potential RSVHs (85% vs 54%) and provides another option to guide cost-effective RSV prophylaxis in Canada.

136,"Palivizumab in the prevention of severe respiratory syncytial virus infection in children with congenital heart disease; a novel cost-utility modeling study reflecting evidence-based clinical pathways in Spain Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection remains one of the major reasons of re-hospitalization among children with congenital heart disease (CHD). This study estimated the cost-effectiveness of palivizumab prophylaxis versus placebo, in Spain, from the societal perspective, using a novel cost-effectiveness model reflecting evidence-based clinical pathways. Methods: A decision-analytic model, combining a decision tree structure in the first year and a Markov structure in later years, was constructed to evaluate the benefits and costs associated with palivizumab versus no prophylaxis among children with CHD. In the first year of the model, children were at risk of mild (i.e. medically attended, MA-RSV) and severe (hospitalized, RSV-H) RSV infection. The impact of delayed corrective CHD surgery due to RSV infection and the consequence of performed surgery despite severe infection were considered. In later years, patients were at risk of developing asthma and allergic sensitization as sequelae of RSV infection. Input data for the model were derived from the pivotal clinical trial and systematic literature reviews. Indirect costs included parental absence from work and nosocomial infections. In agreement with Spanish guidelines, costs and effects were discounted at 3%. Results: Over a lifetime horizon, palivizumab prophylaxis yielded 0.11 and 0.07 additional quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and life years (LYs), respectively, at additional costs of  1,693, resulting in an ICER of  15,748 per QALY gained and  24,936 per LY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the probability of palivizumab prophylaxis being cost-effective at a  30,000 per QALY threshold was 92.7%. The ICER remained below this threshold for most extreme scenario analyses. Conclusions: The model demonstrated that palivizumab prophylaxis results in more QALYs than no prophylaxis in children with CHD. Palivizumab prophylaxis was shown to be a cost-effective health care intervention according to the commonly accepted standards of cost-effectiveness in Spain (ICER below the threshold of  30,000 per QALY).

137,"The cost-effectiveness of palivizumab in the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis: A systematic review Background: The cost-effectiveness of palivizumab is subject of vigorous debate. It is recognized that a policy of using palivizumab for all children who meet the licensed indication is not cost-effective, but most clinicians feel that its use is justified in certain subgroups. Objective: To systematically review the literature on the cost-effectiveness of palivizumab prophylaxis in the following subgroups: 1) preterm infants born before 32 weeks gestational age (WGA), 2) preterm infants born between 32 and 35 WGA, 3) children with chronic lung disease, and 4) children with congenital heart disease. Methods: We searched Pubmed, EMBASE and the latest versions of the DARE, NHS EED and HTA databases from inception to February 2010 using the terms cost, cost-effectiveness, respiratory syncytial virus and palivizumab. Results: Seventeen studies evaluating the cost-effectiveness of palivizumab were included. The cost-effectiveness of palivizumab for the subgroups of children born before 32 WGA, children born between 32 and 35 WGA, children with chronic lung disease (CLD), and children with congenital heart disease was studied in 8, 9, 8, and 6 studies, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios varied considerably both within and between subgroups. Sensitivity analyses showed that cost-effectiveness was mainly driven by the mortality rate due to RSV infection. Differences in hospitalization rates, industry sponsoring and study year were also associated with differences in cost-effectiveness, but these differences could be attributed to differences in mortality rates. Conclusion: The cost-effectiveness of prophylactic treatment of RSV infection with palivizumab in subgroups varies considerably, and is certainly not always below the threshold. The cost-effectiveness is mainly sensitive to mortality rates of RSV infection. This systematic review indicates that future research should focus on the major uncertainties in costeffectiveness, particularly RSV-related mortality rate.  2011 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

138,"Cost of childhood RSV management and cost-effectiveness of RSV interventions: a systematic review from a low- and middle-income country perspective Background: Approximately 97% of global deaths due to RSV occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Until recently, the only licensed preventive intervention has been a shortacting monoclonal antibody (mAb), palivizumab (PVZ) that is expensive and intensive to administer, making it poorly suited for low-resource settings. Currently, new longer acting RSV mAbs and maternal vaccines are emerging from late-stage clinical development with promising clinical effectiveness. However, evidence of economic value and affordability must also be considered if these interventions are to be globally accessible. This systematic reviews objective was to summarise existing evidence on the cost-of-illness (COI) and cost-effectiveness of RSV prevention interventions in LMICs. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review using the Embase, MEDLINE, and Global Index Medicus databases for publications between Jan 2000 and Jan 2022. Two categories of studies in LMICs were targeted: cost-of-illness (COI) of RSV episodes and cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA) of RSV preventive interventions including maternal vaccines and long-acting mAbs. Of the 491 articles reviewed, 19 met the inclusion criteria. Results: COI estimates varied widely: for severe RSV, the cost per episode ranged from $92 to $4114. CEA results also variede.g. evaluations of long-acting mAbs found ICERs from $462/DALY averted to $2971/DALY averted. Study assumptions of input parameters varied substantially and their results often had wide confidence intervals. Conclusions: RSV represents a substantial disease burden; however, evidence of economic burden is limited. Knowledge gaps remain regarding the economic value of new technologies specifically in LMICs. Further research is needed to understand the economic burden of childhood RSV in LMICs and reduce uncertainty about the relative value of anticipated RSV prevention interventions. Most CEA studies evaluated palivizumab with fewer analyses of interventions in development that may be more accessible for LMICs.

139,"Impact and cost-effectiveness of potential interventions against infant respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in 131 low-income and middle-income countries using a static cohort model Objectives Interventions to prevent childhood respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease are limited and costly. New interventions are in advanced stages of development and could be available soon. This study aims to evaluate the potential impact and cost-effectiveness of two interventions to prevent childhood RSV-a maternal vaccine and a monoclonal antibody (mAb). Design Using a static population-based cohort model, we evaluate impact and cost-effectiveness of RSV interventions, from a health systems perspective. The assumed baseline efficacy and duration of protection were higher for the mAb (60%-70% efficacy, protection 6 months) compared with the maternal vaccine (40%-60% efficacy, protection 3 months). Both interventions were evaluated at US$3 and US$5 per dose for Gavi and non-Gavi countries, respectively. A range of input values were considered to explore uncertainty. Settings 131 low-income and middle-income countries. Participants Pregnant women and live birth cohorts. Interventions Maternal vaccine given to pregnant women and mAb given to young infants. Primary and secondary outcome measures Disability-adjusted life years averted, severe case averted, deaths averted, incremental cost effectiveness ratios. Results Under baseline assumptions, maternal vaccine and mAbs were projected to avert 25% and 55% of RSV-related deaths among infants younger than 6 months of age, respectively. The average incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per disability-adjusted life year averted was US$1342 (range US$800-US$1866) for maternal RSV vaccine and US$431 (range US$167-US$692) for mAbs. At a 50% gross domestic product per capita threshold, maternal vaccine and mAbs were cost-effective in 60 and 118 countries, respectively. Conclusions Both interventions are projected to be impactful and cost-effective in many countries, a finding that would be enhanced if country-specific Gavi cofinancing to eligible countries were included. mAbs, with assumed higher efficacy and duration of protection, are expected to be more cost-effective than RSV maternal vaccines at similar prices. Final product characteristics will influence this finding. (Baral R., rbaral@path.org; Higgins D.; Regan K.; Pecenka C.)

140,"Health and economic burden of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease and the cost-effectiveness of potential interventions against RSV among children under 5 years in 72 Gavi-eligible countries Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) frequently causes acute lower respiratory infection in children under 5, representing a high burden in Gavi-eligible countries (mostly low-income and lower-middle-income). Since multiple RSV interventions, including vaccines and monoclonal antibody (mAb) candidates, are under development, we aim to evaluate the key drivers of the cost-effectiveness of maternal vaccination and infant mAb for 72 Gavi countries. Methods: A static Multi-Country Model Application for RSV Cost-Effectiveness poLicy (MCMARCEL) was developed to follow RSV-related events monthly from birth until 5 years of age. MCMARCEL was parameterised using country- A nd age-specific demographic, epidemiological, and cost data. The interventions' level and duration of effectiveness were guided by the World Health Organization's preferred product characteristics and other literature. Maternal vaccination and mAb were assumed to require single-dose administration at prices assumed to align with other Gavi-subsidised technologies. The effectiveness and the prices of the interventions were simultaneously varied in extensive scenario analyses. Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were the primary health outcomes for cost-effectiveness, integrated with probabilistic sensitivity analyses and Expected Value of Partially Perfect Information analysis. Results: The RSV-associated disease burden among children in these 72 countries is estimated at an average of 20.8 million cases, 1.8 million hospital admissions, 40 thousand deaths, 1.2 million discounted DALYs, and US$611 million discounted direct costs. Strategy 'mAb' is more effective due to its assumed longer duration of protection versus maternal vaccination, but it was also assumed to be more expensive. Given all parameterised uncertainty, the optimal strategy of choice tends to change for increasing willingness to pay (WTP) values per DALY averted from the current situation to maternal vaccination (at WTP > US$1000) to mAB (at WTP > US$3500). The age-specific proportions of cases that are hospitalised and/or die cause most of the uncertainty in the choice of optimal strategy. Results are broadly similar across countries. Conclusions: Both the maternal and mAb strategies need to be competitively priced to be judged as relatively cost-effective. Information on the level and duration of protection is crucial, but also more and better disease burden evidence-especially on RSV-attributable hospitalisation and death rates-is needed to support policy choices when novel RSV products become available.

141,"A new cost-utility analysis assessing risk factor-guided prophylaxis with palivizumab for the prevention of severe respiratory syncytial virus infection in Italian infants born at 2935 weeks gestational age Since the last Italian cost-utility assessment of palivizumab in 2009, new data on the burden of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and an International Risk Scoring Tool (IRST) have become available. The objective of this study was to provide an up-to-date cost-utility assessment of palivizumab versus no prophylaxis for the prevention of severe RSV infection in otherwise healthy Italian infants born at 2931 weeks gestational age (wGA) infants and those 3235wGA infants categorized as either moderate- or high-risk of RSV-hospitalization (RSVH) by the IRST. A decision tree was constructed in which infants received palivizumab or no prophylaxis and then could experience: i) RSVH; ii) emergency room medically-attended RSV-infection (MARI); or, iii) remain uninfected/non-medically attended. RSVH cases that required intensive care unit admission could die (0.43%). Respiratory morbidity was considered in all surviving infants up to 18 years of age. Hospitalization rates were derived from Italian data combined with efficacy from the IMpact-RSV trial. Palivizumab costs were calculated from vial prices (50mg: 490.37 100mg: 814.34) and Italian birth statistics combined with a growth algorithm. A lifetime horizon and healthcare and societal costs were included. The incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) was 14814 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained in the whole population (mean: 15430; probability of ICUR being <40000: 0.90). The equivalent ICURs were 15139 per QALY gained (15915; 0.89) for 2931wGA infants and 14719 per QALY gained (15230; 0.89) for 3235wGA infants. The model was most sensitive to rates of long-term sequelae, utility scores, palivizumab cost, and palivizumab efficacy. Palivizumab remained cost-effective in all scenario analyses, including a scenario wherein RSVH infants received palivizumab without a reduction in long-term sequelae and experienced a 6-year duration of respiratory morbidity (ICUR: 27948 per QALY gained). In conclusion, palivizumab remains cost-effective versus no prophylaxis in otherwise healthy Italian preterm infants born 2935wGA. The IRST can help guide cost-effective use of palivizumab in 3235wGA infants.

142,"Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of RSV infant and maternal immunization programs: A case study of Nunavik, Canada Background: Despite passive immunization with palivizumab to select high-risk children under two years of age, the health and economic burden of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) remains substantial. We evaluated the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of immunization programs with new generations of RSV prophylactics, including long-acting monoclonal antibodies (LAMA) and maternal vaccines, in terms of reducing hospitalizations in Nunavik, a Canadian Arctic region. Methods: We developed an agent-based model of RSV transmission and parameterized it with the demographics and burden of RSV in Nunavik, Quebec. We compared various immunization strategies, taking into account the costs associated with program delivery and calculating the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) using quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained as a measure of effectiveness. Scenario analyses included immunization with palivizumab and LAMA for infants under one year of age, and maternal vaccination in mild, moderate, and severe RSV seasons. Data were analysed from November 1, 2019 to May 1, 2021. Findings: We found that a Nunavik pilot program with palivizumab which included healthy full-term infants aged 02 months in addition to those considered high-risk for complicated RSV disease is not cost-effective, compared to offering palivizumab only to preterm/chronically ill infants under 1 year of age. Using LAMA as prophylaxis produces ICER values of CAD $39,414/QALY (95% Credible Interval [CrI]: $39,314$40,017) in a mild season (moderately cost-effective) and CAD $5,255/QALY (95% CrI: $5,222$5,307) in a moderate season (highly cost-effective). LAMA was a dominant (cost-saving with negative incremental costs and positive incremental effects) strategy in a severe RSV season. Maternal vaccination combined with immunization of preterm/chronically ill infants 311 months was also a dominant (cost-saving) strategy in all seasons. Interpretation: The switch from palivizumab in RSV immunization programs to new prophylactics would lead to significant savings, with LAMA being an effective strategy without compromising benefits in terms of reducing hospitalizations.

143,"Estimating the cost-effectiveness of maternal vaccination and monoclonal antibodies for respiratory syncytial virus in Kenya and South Africa Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes a substantial burden of acute lower respiratory infection in children under 5 years, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Maternal vaccine (MV) and next-generation monoclonal antibody (mAb) candidates have been shown to reduce RSV disease in infants in phase 3 clinical trials. The cost-effectiveness of these biologics has been estimated using disease burden data from global meta-analyses, but these are sensitive to the detailed age breakdown of paediatric RSV disease, for which there have previously been limited data. Methods: We use original hospital-based incidence data from South Africa (ZAF) and Kenya (KEN) collected between 2010 and 2018 of RSV-associated acute respiratory infection (ARI), influenza-like illness (ILI), and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) as well as deaths with monthly age-stratification, supplemented with data on healthcare-seeking behaviour and costs to the healthcare system and households. We estimated the incremental cost per DALY averted (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio or ICER) of public health interventions by MV or mAb for a plausible range of prices (550 USD for MV, 10125 USD for mAb), using an adjusted version of a previously published health economic model of RSV immunisation. Results: Our data show higher disease incidence for infants younger than 6 months of age in the case of Kenya and South Africa than suggested by earlier projections from community incidence-based meta-analyses of LMIC data. Since MV and mAb provide protection for these youngest age groups, this leads to a substantially larger reduction of disease burden and, therefore, more favourable cost-effectiveness of both interventions in both countries. Using the latest efficacy data and inferred coverage levels based on antenatal care (ANC-3) coverage (KEN: 61.7%, ZAF: 75.2%), our median estimate of the reduction in RSV-associated deaths in children under 5 years in Kenya is 10.5% (95% CI: 7.9, 13.3) for MV and 13.5% (10.7, 16.4) for mAb, while in South Africa, it is 27.4% (21.6, 32.3) and 37.9% (32.3, 43.0), respectively. Starting from a dose price of 5 USD, in Kenya, net cost (for the healthcare system) per (undiscounted) DALY averted for MV is 179 (126, 267) USD, rising to 1512 (1166, 2070) USD at 30 USD per dose; for mAb, it is 684 (543, 895) USD at 20 USD per dose and 1496 (1203, 1934) USD at 40 USD per dose. In South Africa, a MV at 5 USD per dose would be net cost-saving for the healthcare system and net cost per DALY averted is still below the ZAFs GDP per capita at 40 USD dose price (median: 2350, 95% CI: 1720, 3346). For mAb in ZAF, net cost per DALY averted is 247 (46, 510) USD at 20 USD per dose, rising to 2028 (1565, 2638) USD at 50 USD per dose and to 6481 (5364, 7959) USD at 125 USD per dose. Conclusions: Incorporation of new data indicating the disease burden is highly concentrated in the first 6 months of life in two African settings suggests that interventions against RSV disease may be more cost-effective than previously estimated.

144,"Over-The-Counter Hearing Aids: Trends in Information-Seeking Behavior Recent Food and Drug Administration approval of over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aids has changed the policy landscape surrounding hearing-assistive technology. Our objective was to characterize trends in information-seeking behavior in the era of OTC hearing aids. Using Google Trends, we extracted the relative search volume (RSV) for hearing health-related topics. The mean RSV in the 2 weeks preceding and following enactment of the FDA's OTC hearing aid ruling were compared using a paired samples t-test. RSV for hearing-related queries increased by 212.5% on the date of FDA approval. There was a 25.6% (p =.02) increase in mean RSV for hearing aids before and after the FDA ruling. The most popular searches focused on specific device brands and cost. States with more rural residents represented the highest proportion of queries. Understanding these trends is critical to ensure appropriate patient counseling and improve access to hearing assistive technology.

145,"Cost-effectiveness of infant respiratory syncytial virus preventive interventions in Mali: A modeling study to inform policy and investment decisions Importance: Low- and middle-income countries have a high burden of respiratory syncytial virus lower respiratory tract infections. A monoclonal antibody administered monthly is licensed to prevent these infections, but it is cost-prohibitive for most low- and middle-income countries. Long-acting monoclonal antibodies and maternal vaccines against respiratory syncytial virus are under development. Objective: We estimated the likelihood of respiratory syncytial virus preventive interventions (current monoclonal antibody, long-acting monoclonal antibody, and maternal vaccine) being cost-effective in Mali. Design: We modeled age-specific and season-specific risks of respiratory syncytial virus lower respiratory tract infections within monthly cohorts of infants from birth to six months. We parameterized with respiratory syncytial virus data from Malian cohort studies, as well as product efficacy from clinical trials. Integrating parameter uncertainty, we simulated health and economic outcomes for status quo without prevention, intra-seasonal monthly administration of licensed monoclonal antibody, pre-seasonal birth dose administration of a long-acting monoclonal antibody, and maternal vaccination. We then calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of each intervention compared to status quo from the perspectives of the government, donor, and society. Results: At a price of $3 per dose and from the societal perspective, current monoclonal antibody, long-acting monoclonal antibody, and maternal vaccine would have incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $4280 (95% CI $1892 to $122,434), $1656 (95% CI $734 to $9091), and $8020 (95% CI $3501 to $47,047) per disability-adjusted life-year averted, respectively. Conclusions and Relevance: In Mali, long-acting monoclonal antibody is likely to be cost-effective from both the government and donor perspectives at $3 per dose. Maternal vaccine would need higher efficacy over that measured by a recent trial in order to be considered cost-effective.

146,"Cost-effectiveness analysis of the administration of palivizumab as prophylaxis of severe bronchiolitis due to respiratory syncytial virus Background. Several clinical trials of palivizumab have shown a decrease of hospitalizations for severe respiratory syncytial virus infection. However, its high price makes it necessary for an evaluation to be done. Objective. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of the administration of palivizumab on the prophylaxis of severe bronchiolitis related to respiratory syncytial virus. Method. A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed by means of a decision analysis model. We used a payer perspective, a one-year and life expectancy time horizon, and a 3% discount rate. Direct costs were included (drug, administration, and hospital admission), and several sensitivity analyses were performed. Results. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios obtained were between 17,337.10 and 68,380.77  per avoided hospitalization, and between 166,721.18 and 1,476,568.81  per life year gained. For premature infants younger than 32 weeks of gestational age, the price of a 3-dose treatment should be 400  (133.33  per dose) to obtain a ratio lower than 30,000  per life year gained; the price of a 3-dose treatment should be 140.08  (46.69  per dose) to obtain a ratio cheaper than the cost of a 5 in-hospital days. Conclusions. Even in the most favorable scenario, the cost of the treatment with palivizumab is much higher than the cost of a complete hospitalization episode, and the incremental cost per life year gained is much higher than commonly accepted thresholds.

148,"The cost-effectiveness of palivizumab for respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis in premature infants with a gestational age of 32-35 weeks: A Canadian-based analysis Background: Prophylactic therapy with palivizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, has been shown to reduce the number of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-related hospitalizations in preterm infants, including those in the 32-35 weeks' gestational age (GA) subgroup. The cost-effectiveness of this therapy in Canada is unknown. Objectives: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of palivizumab as respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis in premature infants born at 32-35 weeks' GA. Design: A decision analytic model was designed to compare both direct and indirect medical costs and benefits of prophylaxis in this subgroup of premature infants. Sensitivity analyses were performed to ascertain the robustness of the model for five point estimates: mortality rate, discounting rates, health-utility values, degree of vial-sharing and administration costs. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was also conducted. Setting: Canadian publicly funded health-care system (Ministry of Health payer perspective) for base-case analysis. Societal perspective, accounting for future lost productivity, was adopted for a secondary analysis. Participants: Canadian infants born at 32-35 weeks' GA without chronic lung disease. Interventions: Palivizumab prophylaxis versus no prophylaxis. Main outcome measures: Expected costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio expressed as cost per life-year gained (LYG) and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) using 2007 Canadian dollars. Results: The expected costs were higher for palivizumab prophylaxis as compared with no prophylaxis. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for the base-case scenario was $20 924 per QALY after discounting, which is considered cost-effective in Canada. When the uncertainty of the input parameter assumptions was tested through sensitivity analyses assessing several data sources for five key parameters, no substantial differences were found from the base-case results. The PSA indicated a 0.99 probability that the ICER for palivizumab was less than $50 000/QALY. Sub-analyses that varied the number of risk factors found that for infants with two or more risk factors, or at least moderate risk, palivizumab had incremental costs per QALY that indicated moderate-to-strong evidence for adoption (range: $808-81 331, per QALY). Conclusions: Palivizumab was cost-effective and the authors' model supports prophylaxis for infants born at 32-35 weeks' GA, particularly those with more than two risk factors or at least a moderate level of risk according to a risk scoring tool.  2008 Informa UK Ltd.

149,"Cost-effectiveness of Prefusion F Protein-based Vaccines Against Respiratory Syncytial Virus Disease for Older Adults in the United States BACKGROUND: Two prefusion F protein-based vaccines, Arexvy and Abrysvo, have been authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration for protecting older adults against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-associated lower respiratory tract illness. We evaluated the health benefits and cost-effectiveness of these vaccines. METHODS: We developed a discrete-event simulation model, parameterized with the burden of RSV disease including outpatient care, hospitalization, and death for adults aged 60 years or older in the United States. Taking into account the costs associated with these RSV-related outcomes, we calculated the net monetary benefit using quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained as a measure of effectiveness and determined the range of price-per-dose (PPD) for Arexvy and Abrysvo vaccination programs to be cost-effective from a societal perspective. RESULTS: Using a willingness-to-pay of $95 000 per QALY gained, we found that vaccination programs could be cost-effective for a PPD up to $127 with Arexvy and $118 with Abrysvo over the first RSV season. Achieving an influenza-like vaccination coverage of 66% for the population of older adults in the United States, the budget impact of these programs at the maximum PPD ranged from $6.48 to $6.78 billion. If the benefits of vaccination extend to a second RSV season as reported in clinical trials, we estimated a maximum PPD of $235 for Arexvy and $245 for Abrysvo, with 2-year budget impacts of $11.78 and $12.25 billion, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination of older adults would provide substantial direct health benefits by reducing outcomes associated with RSV-related illness in this population. (Moghadas S.M.; Shoukat A.)

The most efficient way to use these products when they become available is an important consideration for public health decision makers. Methods We performed a multivariate regression analysis to estimate the burden of RSV in children younger than 5 years in England (UK), a representative high-income temperate country, and used these results to assess the potential effect of different RSV immunisation strategies (targeting vaccination for infants, or pregnant women, or prophylactic antibodies for neonates). We did a cost-effectiveness analysis for these strategies, implemented either separately or concurrently, and assessed the effect of restricting vaccination to certain months of the year. Findings We estimated that RSV is responsible for 12 primary care consultations (95% CI 119121) and 09 admissions to hospital annually per 100 children younger than 5 years (95% CI 089090), with the major burden occurring in infants younger than 6 months. The most cost-effective strategy was to selectively immunise all children born before the start of the RSV season (maximum price of 220 [95% uncertainty interval (UI) 208232] per vaccine, for an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 20 000 per quality-adjusted life-year). The maximum price per fully protected person that should be paid for the infant, newborn, and maternal strategies without seasonal restrictions was 192 (95% UI 168219), 81 (7686), and 54 (5157), respectively. Interpretation Nearly double the number of primary care consultations, and nearly five times the number of admissions to hospital occurred with RSV compared with influenza. RSV vaccine and antibody strategies are likely to be cost-effective if they can be priced below around 200 per fully protected person. A seasonal vaccination strategy is likely to provide the most direct benefits. Herd effects might render a year-round infant vaccination strategy more appealing, although it is currently unclear whether such a programme would induce herd effects.

151,"Potential cost-effectiveness of RSV vaccination of infants and pregnant women in Turkey: An illustration based on bursa data Background Worldwide, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is considered to be the most important viral cause of respiratory morbidity and mortality among infants and young children. Although no active vaccine is available on the market yet, there are several active vaccine development programs in various stages. To assess whether one of these vaccines might be a future asset for national immunization programs, modeling the costs and benefits of various vaccination strategies is needed. Objectives To evaluate the potential cost-effectiveness of RSV vaccination of infants and/or pregnant women in Turkey. Methods A multi-cohort static Markov model with cycles of one month was used to compare the costeffectiveness of vaccinated cohorts versus non-vaccinated cohorts. The 2014 Turkish birth cohort was divided by twelve to construct twelve monthly birth cohorts of equal size (111,459 new-borns). Model input was based on clinical data from a multicenter prospective study from Bursa, Turkey, combined with figures from the (inter)national literature and publicly available data from the Turkish Statistical Institute (TUIK). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were expressed in Turkish Lira (TL) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Results Vaccinating infants at 2 and 4 months of age would prevent 145,802 GP visits, 8,201 hospitalizations and 48 deaths during the first year of life, corresponding to a total gain of 1650 QALYs. The discounted ICER was estimated at 51,969 TL (26,220 US $ in 2013) per QALY gained. Vaccinating both pregnant women and infants would prevent more cases, but was less attractive from a pure economic point of view with a discounted ICER of 61,653 TL (31,106 US $ in 2013) per QALY. Vaccinating only during pregnancy would result in fewer cases prevented than infant vaccination and a less favorable ICER. Conclusion RSV vaccination of infants and/or pregnant women has the potential to be cost-effective in Turkey. Although using relatively conservative assumptions, all evaluated strategies remained slightly below the threshold of 3 times the GDP per capita. (Pouwels K.B., k.b.pouwels@gmail.com; Postma M.J.)

152,"The efficiency (cost-effectiveness) of palivizumab as prophylaxis against respiratory syncytial virus infection in premature infants with a gestational age of 32-35 weeks in Spain Objectives: To evaluate the efficiency (cost-effectiveness) of palivizumab in preventing severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in premature infants with a gestational age of 32-35 weeks (GA 32-35) and two or more risk factors (RF) in Spain. Methods: Design: decision tree model using data from the scientific literature and the FLIP I and FLIP II studies (cohort of 326 infants with GA 32-35 and two or more RF who received palivizumab) sponsored by the Spanish Society of Neonatology. Main effectiveness measure: quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained. Perspectives: the national health service (NHS), which includes direct costs (administration of palivizumab and hospital admissions), and the societal perspective, which also includes indirect costs (the child's future lost productivity). Discount: 3 % annually for effectiveness and indirect costs. Sensitivity analysis: construction of 37 scenarios modifying variables related to effectiveness and costs. Results: Prophylaxis with palivizumab in premature infants with GA 32-35 and two or more RF produced an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 13,849 /QALY from the NHS perspective, and an ICER of 4,605 /QALY from the societal perspective. In the sensitivity analysis, from the NHS perspective the ICER ranged from 5,351 /QALY (most favorable scenario) to 23,276 /QALY (least favorable scenario). Conclusions: Palivizumab is a cost-effective therapy as prophylaxis against RSV in infants with GA 32-35 and two or more RF. Its use is efficient from the NHS perspective, since the cost of a QALY, even in the least favorable scenarios, is lower than the threshold of 30,000 /QALY considered socially acceptable in Spain.

153,"Updated cost-effectiveness analysis of palivizumab (Synagis) for the prophylaxis of respiratory syncytial virus in infant populations in the UK Aims: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common cause of respiratory infection in infants and severe infection can result in hospitalization. The passive immunization, palivizumab, is used as prophylaxis against RSV, however, use in the UK is restricted to populations at high risk of hospitalization. This study assesses the cost-effectiveness (CE) of palivizumab in premature infants with and without risk factors for hospitalization (congenital heart disease [CHD], bronchopulmonary dysplasia [BPD]). Methods: A decision tree model, based on earlier CE analyses, was updated using data derived from targeted literature reviews and advice gained from a Round Table meeting. All costs were updated to 2019 prices. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the degree of uncertainty surrounding the results. Results: Palivizumab is dominant (i.e. clinically superior and cost saving) when used in premature infants born 35 weeks gestational age (wGA) without CHD or BPD and aged <6 months at the start of the RSV season, infants aged <24 months with CHD and infants aged <24 months requiring treatment for BPD within the last 6 months. Limitations: One-way sensitivity analysis suggests that these results are highly sensitive to the efficacy of prophylaxis, number of doses, impact of long-term respiratory sequalae, rate of hospitalization and mortality due to RSV. A conservative approach has been taken toward long-term respiratory sequalae due to uncertainty around epidemiology and etiology and a lack of recent cost and utility data. Conclusions: Palivizumab prophylaxis is cost-effective in preventing severe RSV infection requiring hospital admission in a wider population than currently recommended in UK guidelines. Prophylaxis in premature infants born <29 wGA, 2932 wGA and 3335 wGA without CHD or BPD aged <6 months at the start of the RSV season is not funded under current guidance, however, prophylaxis has been demonstrated to be cost-effective in this analysis.

154,"Cost-effectiveness of palivizumab in infancy Respiratory syncytial virus is the most common cause of bronchiolitis, a lower respiratory tract infection occurring in infancy. It is responsible for several rehospitalizations, substantial morbidity and occasional deaths in the UK every year. Palivizumab is a recombinant monoclonal antibody that has been shown to reduce hospitalizations in infected infants. It is licensed for high-risk infants, primarily those born pro-term or with chronic pulmonary or cardiac conditions. Palivizumab is expensive, but several economic analyses have determined highly discrepant costs. This article reviews the limitations of the available efficacy and economic data, and highlights problems in interpretation and extrapolation.

155,"Cost-effectiveness of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Disease Prevention Strategies: Maternal Vaccine Versus Seasonal or Year-Round Monoclonal Antibody Program in Norwegian Children Background. Every winter, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease results in thousands of cases in Norwegian children under 5 years of age. We aim to assess the RSV-related economic burden and the cost-effectiveness of upcoming RSV disease prevention strategies including year-round maternal immunization and year-round and seasonal monoclonal antibody (mAb) programs. Methods. Epidemiological and cost data were obtained from Norwegian national registries, while quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) lost and intervention characteristics were extracted from literature and phase 3 clinical trials. A static model was used and uncertainty was accounted for probabilistically. Value of information was used to assess decision uncertainty. Extensive scenario analyses were conducted, including accounting for long-term consequences of RSV disease. Results. We estimate an annual average of 13 517 RSV cases and 1572 hospitalizations in children under 5, resulting in 79.6 million Norwegian kroner (~8 million) treatment costs. At 51 per dose for all programs, a 4-month mAb program for neonates born in November to February is the cost-effective strategy for willingness to pay (WTP) values up to 40 000 per QALY gained. For higher WTP values, the longer 6-month mAb program that immunizes neonates from October to March becomes cost-effective. Sensitivity analyses show that year-round maternal immunization can become a cost-effective strategy if priced lower than mAb. Conclusions. Assuming the same pricing, seasonal mAb programs are cost-effective over year-round programs in Norway. The timing and duration of the cost-effective seasonal program are sensitive to the pattern of the RSV season in a country, so continued RSV surveillance data are essential.

156,"Cost-effectiveness of strategies for preventing paediatric lower respiratory infections associated with respiratory syncytial virus in eight Chinese cities Background: New monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and vaccines against RSV with promising efficacy and protection duration are expected to be available in the near future. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of the administration of maternal immunisation (MI), infant mAb (IA) and paediatric immunisation (PI) as well as their combinations in eight Chinese cities. Methods: We used a static model to estimate the impact of these preventive interventions on reducing the burden of RSV-ALRI in twelve monthly birth cohorts from a societal perspective. In addition to year-round administration, we also considered seasonal administration of MI and IA (i.e., administered only to children born in selected months). The primary outcome was threshold strategy cost (TSC), defined as the maximum costs per child for a strategy to be cost-effective. Results: With a willingness-to-pay threshold of one national GDP per capita per QALY gained for all the cities, TSC of year-round strategies was: (i) US$2.4 (95% CI: 1.9-3.4) to US$14.7 (11.6-21.4) for MI; (ii) US$19.9 (16.9-25.9) to US$144.2 (124.6-184.7) for IA; (iii) US$28.7 (22.0-42.0) to US$201.0 (156.5-298.6) for PI; (iv) US$31.1 (24.0-45.5) to US$220.7 (172.0-327.3) for maternal plus paediatric immunisation (MPI); and (v) US$41.3 (32.6-58.9) to US$306.2 (244.1-441.3) for infant mAb plus paediatric immunisation (AP). In all cities, the top ten seasonal strategies (ranked by TSC) protected infants from 5 or fewer monthly birth cohorts. Conclusions: Administration of these interventions could be cost-effective if they are suitably priced. Suitably-timed seasonal administration could be more cost-effective than their year-round counterpart. Our results can inform the optimal strategy once these preventive interventions are commercially available.

157,"Cost-effectiveness analysis of palivizumab versus no prophylaxis in the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus infections among premature infants, with different gestational ages Introduction: The aim of this study was to asses the cost-effectiveness of palivizumab versus no prophylaxis in the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus infections among premature infants. Methods: We built a model in which two cohorts of patients received palivizumab or no prophylaxis. The patients were followed for 14 years. The analysis was conducted from the perspective of the Italian National Health Service. We considered Life Years Gained (LYGs), Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs) and direct medical costs (pharmacological treatment, hospitalization, recurrences for asthma, etc.). LYGs and QALYs were based on the results of an international clinical trial and direct medical costs were based on Italian treatment patterns. Benefits and costs were discounted at 3%. Sensitivity analyses on key clinical and economic parameters were performed. Results: For the two cohorts expected life-years (per patient) with palivizumab versus no prophylaxis were respectively 29.842 and 29.754 years. Quality-adjusted life years (per patient) with palivizumab were 29.196, and for no prophylaxis were 29.030. The expected cost (per patient) was  8,131.14 with palivizumab and  6,386.92 with no prophylaxis. We calculated for palivizumab versus no prophylaxis the incremental cost per LYG and per QALY gained. It was  19,813.08 and  10,524.21, respectively. Conclusions: This study suggests that, compared with no prophylaxis, palivizumab is cost-effective in the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus infection among premature infants.  2006 Adis Data Information BV.

158,"Cost-effectiveness analysis of nirsevimab and maternal RSVpreF vaccine strategies for prevention of Respiratory Syncytial Virus disease among infants in Canada: a simulation study Background: The cost-effectiveness of immunisation strategies with a long-acting monoclonal antibody (nirsevimab) and/or a protein-based maternal vaccine (RSVpreF) for protecting infants from Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)-associated illness has not been previously determined for Canada. We estimated the health benefits and cost-effectiveness of nirsevimab for immunising the entire birth cohort, regardless of gestational age or other risk factors. Additionally, we evaluated the health benefits and cost-effectiveness of a combined strategy of year-round vaccination of pregnant women with RSVpreF and immunisation of infants at high risk, including those born preterm or with chronic conditions, with nirsevimab during the RSV season. Methods: We developed a discrete-event simulation model, parameterized with the data on medically-attended RSV infections among infants under one year of age from 2010 to 2019, including outpatient care, hospitalisations, and deaths. Intervention scenarios targeting twelve monthly birth cohorts and pregnant women, reflecting the 2021 census data for Ontario, Canada were evaluated over a follow-up time horizon of one year from birth. Taking into account the costs (in 2023 Canadian dollars) associated with RSV-related outcomes, we calculated the net monetary benefit using the quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Further, we determined the range of price-per-dose (PPD) for nirsevimab and RSVpreF within which the program was cost-effective. Cost-effectiveness analyses were conducted from both healthcare and societal perspectives. Findings: Using a willingness-to-pay of CAD$50,000 per QALY gained, we found that immunising the entire birth cohort with nirsevimab would be cost-effective from a societal perspective for a PPD of up to $290, with an annual budget impact of $83,978 for 1113 infants per 100,000 population. An alternative, combined strategy of vaccinating pregnant women and immunising only infants at high risk of severe disease would lead to a lower budget impact of $49,473 per 100,000 population with a PPD of $290 and $195 for nirsevimab and RSVpreF vaccine, respectively. This combined strategy would reduce infant mortality by 76%85%, comparable to a 78% reduction achieved through a nirsevimab-only program of the entire birth cohort. The PPD for cost-effective programs with nirsevimab was sensitive to the target population among infants. Interpretation: Passive immunisation of infants under 6 months of age with nirsevimab and vaccination of pregnant women with RSVpreF could be a cost-effective strategy for protecting infants during their first RSV season.

159,"Cost-effectiveness analysis of palivizumab in premature infants without chronic lung disease Objectives: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of palivizumab as respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis in premature infants without chronic lung disease and to evaluate the impact on cost-effectiveness of a potential reduction in risk of asthma following respiratory syncytial virus infection among infants receiving palivizumab. Design: Two decision analytic models were designed, one with and the other without accounting for increased risk of asthma following respiratory syncytial virus infection. Setting: A hypothetical community or university hospital. Participants: Hypothetical cohorts of infants without chronic lung disease born at 26 to 32 weeks' gestation. Interventions: Palivizumab prophylaxis vs no prophylaxis. Main Outcome Measures: Expected costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio expressed as cost per quality-adjusted life-year. Results: The expected costs were higher for palivizumab prophylaxis as compared with no prophylaxis. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were high for all gestations and are not considered cost-effective by today's standards (<$200 000 per quality-adjusted life-year). Both models were sensitive to variation in the cost of palivizumab. The model that included asthma was sensitive to variation in quality of life for children with asthma. In instances where asthma was considered severe with profound worsening in quality of life compared with life without asthma, some infants had an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year that was less than $200 000. Conclusions: Our model supports implementing more restrictive guidelines for palivizumab prophylaxis. Palivizumab was cost-effective for some infants in an analysis that accounted for increased risk of severe asthma following respiratory syncytial virus infection. 2006 American Medical Association.

160,"Cost-effectiveness analysis of palivizumab among pre-term infant populations covered by Medicaid in the United States Objective: Medicaid infants are at high risk of severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease. The study objective was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of palivizumab in a Medicaid population. Methods: A societal cost-utility analysis was conducted of prophylaxis with palivizumab vs no prophylaxis among four groups of premature infants: (1) <32 weeks gestational age (wGA) and 6 months chronologic age (CA); (2) 32-34 wGA, 3 months CA with 2009 American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) risk factors (RF); (3) 32-35 wGA, 6 months CA with 2006 AAP RF; and (4) 32-35 wGA, 6 months CA with 1 RF. Full dosing of palivizumab was assumed throughout the RSV season (consistent with the FDA-Approved label). All costs were in 2010 US dollars. The societal public payer spend for palivizumab was estimated using Medicaid reimbursement methodologies for the top 10 palivizumab-using states in 2010 minus mandatory manufacturer rebates. This study reports the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in cost per quality-Adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Sensitivity and probabilistic analyses were also conducted. Results: Palivizumab saved costs and improved QALYs among infants <32 wGA. Palivizumab was cost-effective in infants 32-34 wGA with 2009 AAP RF ($16,037 per QALY) and in infants 32-35 wGA with 2006 AAP RF ($38,244 per QALY). The ICER for infants 32-35 wGA with 1 RF was $281,892 per QALY. Influential variables in the sensitivity analysis included the background rate of RSV hospitalization, the cost of palivizumab, and the efficacy of palivizumab. Key limitations: These results are not generalizable to commercially insured infants or infants outside of the US. Conclusions: This is the first cost-utility analysis of palivizumab in a Medicaid population. Palivizumab, when dosed consistent with the FDA-Approved labeling, was either cost-saving or cost-effective among current guideline-eligible infants in the Medicaid population.

161,"Evaluating the next generation of RSV intervention strategies: a mathematical modelling study and cost-effectiveness analysis Background: With a suite of promising new RSV prophylactics on the horizon, including long-acting monoclonal antibodies and new vaccines, it is likely that one or more of these will replace the current monoclonal Palivizumab programme. However, choosing the optimal intervention programme will require balancing the costs of the programmes with the health benefits accrued. Methods: To compare the next generation of RSV prophylactics, we integrated a novel transmission model with an economic analysis. We estimated key epidemiological parameters by calibrating the model to 7 years of historical epidemiological data using a Bayesian approach. We determined the cost-effective and affordable maximum purchase price for a comprehensive suite of intervention programmes. Findings: Our transmission model suggests that maternal protection of infants is seasonal, with 3862% of infants born with protection against RSV. Our economic analysis found that to cost-effectively and affordably replace the current monoclonal antibody Palivizumab programme with long-acting monoclonal antibodies, the purchase price per dose would have to be less than around 4350 but dropping to 200 for vaccinated heightened risk infants or 90 for all infants. A seasonal maternal vaccine would have to be priced less than 85 to be cost-effective and affordable. While vaccinating pre-school and school-age children is likely not cost-effective relative to elderly vaccination programmes, vaccinating the elderly is not likely to be affordable. Conversely, vaccinating infants at 2 months seasonally would be cost-effective and affordable if priced less than 80. Conclusions: In a setting with seasonal RSV epidemiology, maternal protection conferred to newborns is also seasonal, an assumption not previously incorporated in transmission models of RSV. For a country with seasonal RSV dynamics like England, seasonal programmes rather than year-round intervention programmes are always optimal.

162,"Cost-effectiveness of palivizumab in New Zealand Objective: To establish the preterm infant hospitalization risks from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in New Zealand and the net cost per hospitalization averted by palivizumab. Methods: The 437 infants born < 32 weeks' gestation in 1997 and treated at five major neonatal units were identified. Subsequent admissions during the next 2 years for bronchiolitis, pneumonia and croup were tracked, and information collected on RSV tests performed. Data on the length of stay and hospital costs were used to calculate the potential net cost per hospitalization averted associated with the use of palivizumab and the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one hospitalization. Results: Estimated RSV readmission risk before 1 year corrected age in infants <32 weeks' gestation discharged home on oxygen, and those 28 weeks' gestation, or between 29 and 31 weeks' gestation with or without chronic lung disease was 42%, 23%, 19%, 10% and 8%, respectively. The NNT with palivizumab to prevent one hospitalization ranged from six to 26 across subgroups. Mean (range) net cost per hospitalization averted was $NZ60 000 ($28 600-$166 700). In no subgroup would prophylaxis result in net cost saving. Prophylaxis for all NZ infants 28 weeks' gestation would cost approximately $1 090 000 net and prevent 29 hospitalizations annually, being equivalent to $37 000 net per hospitalization averted, with eight infants treated to prevent one hospitalization. Alternative assumptions about cost and efficacy failed to alter these findings. Conclusion: If value is placed on preventing morbidity, the priority groups for palivizumab prophylaxis are preterm infants discharged home on oxygen, followed by preterm infants of 28 weeks' gestation or less.

163,"Cost-effectiveness analysis of switching from trivalent to quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccine in Argentina The burden of seasonal influenza disease in Argentina is considerable. The cost-effectiveness of trivalent (TIV) versus quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV) in Argentina was assessed. An agestratified, static, decision-tree model compared the costs and benefits of vaccination for an average influenza season. Main outcomes included: numbers of influenza cases; general practitioner (GP) visits; complicated ambulatory cases; hospitalizations; deaths averted; and costs per quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. Epidemiological data from Argentina for 2014-2019 were used to determine the proportion of A and B strain cases, and the frequency of mismatch between vaccine and circulating B strains. To manage uncertainty, one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Switching from TIV to QIV would prevent 19,128 influenza cases, 16,164 GP visits, 2440 complicated ambulatory cases, 524 hospitalizations, and 82 deaths. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) per QALY were 13,590 and 11,678 USD from the payers and societal perspectives, respectively. The greatest health benefits and direct medical cost savings would occur in  65-year-olds. One-way sensitivity analyses demonstrated the principal drivers of ICER to be vaccine acquisition costs, environmental B strain predominance, and B strain mismatch. Introducing QIV in Argentina would be beneficial and cost-effective relative to TIV, particularly in older adults.

164,"Mortality Among US Infants and Children Under 5 Years of Age with Respiratory Syncytial Virus and Bronchiolitis: A Systematic Literature Review Background: A systematic literature review was conducted to summarize the mortality (overall and by disease severity factors) of US infants and children aged <5 years with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) or all-cause bronchiolitis (ACB). Methods: Comprehensive, systematic literature searches were conducted; articles were screened using prespecified eligibility criteria. A standard risk of bias tool was used to evaluate studies. Mortality was extracted as the rate per 100 000 or the case fatality ratio (CFR; proportion of deaths among RSV/ACB cases). Results: Among 42 included studies, 36 evaluated inpatient deaths; 10 used nationally representative populations updated through 2013, and only 2 included late-preterm/full-term otherwise healthy infants and children. The RSV/ACB definition varied across studies (multiple International Classification of Diseases [ICD] codes; laboratory confirmation); no study reported systematic testing for RSV. No studies reported RSV mortality rates, while 3 studies provided ACB mortality rates (0.57-9.4 per 100 000). CFRs ranged from 0% to 1.7% for RSV (n = 15) and from 0% to 0.17% for ACB (n = 6); higher CFRs were reported among premature, intensive care unit-admitted, and publicly insured infants and children. Conclusions: RSV mortality reported among US infants and children is variable. Current, nationally representative estimates are needed for otherwise healthy, late-preterm to full-term infants and children. (Bylsma L.C., lbylsma@epidstrategies.com; Suh M.; Movva N.; Fryzek J.P.)

165,"Cost-effectiveness of palivizumab in infants with congenital heart disease: A Swedish perspective Background: Infants with congenital heart disease (CHD) have an increased risk of morbidity and mortality during a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. The aim of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of palivizumab as RSV-prophylaxis among infants with CHD, including the effect of delayed heart surgery and asthma. Methods: A simulation model with data from the literature and health care authorities including costs and utilities was developed to estimate costs and health effects over a lifetime for a cohort of CHD infants receiving palivizumab compared to no RSV-prophylaxis. Results: The prophylaxis treatment incurred a cost of 3664 EUR per treated infant. However, due to cost-savings from primarily avoiding hospitalizations (5145 EUR/treated infant) and avoiding heart complications due to delayed heart surgery (2082 EUR/treated infant), the RSV-prophylaxis treatment resulted in a total cost-saving of 3833 EUR per treated infant. At the same time, the prophylaxis-treated cohort accumulated more life-years and higher quality of life than the non-prophylaxis cohort. Conclusion: This study confirms that RSV-prophylaxis in severe CHD infants less than one year of age is cost beneficial. Avoiding delayed heart surgeries is an important benefit of prophylaxis and should be taken into consideration.

166,"Aetiology and outcome of severe community-acquired pneumonia in children admitted to a paediatric intensive care unit Objective. To determine the aetiological agents and outcome of severe community-acquired pneumonia (SCAP) in children admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) at Kalafong Hospital, Pretoria. Patients and methods. An audit was done after a protocol was implemented to identify the aetiological agents in children with life-threatening SCAP admitted to the PICU from the emergency room. The following investigations were done as per protocol: blood culture, culture of the tracheal aspirate, immunofluorescence and culture of the nasopharyngeal aspirate, microscopy and culture of the gastric juice for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and determination of HIV status. The following data, documented prospectively, were obtained from patient records: date of admission, age, gender, weight, duration of ventilation, duration of stay in the PICU, survival or death, and severity of illness as determined by means of the score for acute neonatal physiology (SNAP) or paediatric risk of mortality (PRISM) score depending on the child's age. Results. Twenty-three children were admitted over a 1-year period (1 November 1994 - 30 October 1995). Their median age was 10 weeks (range 2 weeks - 5 years) and the sex distribution was equal. Two children were HIV-infected. Twenty children received mechanical ventilation for a median period of 6.5 days (range 2 - 16 days). Aetiological agents were identified in 15/23 children (65%). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most common pathogen, identified in 7/23 children. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most common bacterial pathogen, identified in 5 children (2 blood cultures and 3 tracheal aspirates). Tuberculosis was not diagnosed. The mean PRISM score was similar in survivors and children who died. The case fatality rate was 30%. The 7 children who died had a median arterial oxygen tension/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO(2)/FiO(2)) ratio of 94 (range 32 - 111) and the 16 survivors had a median ratio of 146 (range 51 - 252) (P = 0.01) on admission. Both HIV-infected children died and postmortem examination showed a pneumonia due to Pneumocystis carinii and cytomegalovirus. Conclusions. SCAP occurs in very young children. One or more pathogens were isolated in 65% of cases. Viral pathogens predominated, with RSV being the most common. The yield of positive blood cultures was low at 17%. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were not found. The case fatality rate was 30% and death was more likely with a low PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio on admission. (Delport S.D.)

167,"Cost-effectiveness of pharmaceutical strategies to prevent respiratory syncytial virus disease in young children: a decision-support model for use in low-income and middle-income countries Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of respiratory disease in young children. A number of mathematical models have been used to assess the cost-effectiveness of RSV prevention strategies, but these have not been designed for ease of use by multidisciplinary teams working in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods: We describe the UNIVAC decision-support model (a proportionate outcomes static cohort model) and its approach to exploring the potential cost-effectiveness of two RSV prevention strategies: a single-dose maternal vaccine and a single-dose long-lasting monoclonal antibody (mAb) for infants. We identified model input parameters for 133 LMICs using evidence from the literature and selected national datasets. We calculated the potential cost-effectiveness of each RSV prevention strategy (compared to nothing and to each other) over the lifetimes of all children born in the year 2025 and compared our results to a separate model published by PATH. We ran sensitivity and scenario analyses to identify the inputs with the largest influence on the cost-effectiveness results. Results: Our illustrative results assuming base case input assumptions for maternal vaccination ($3.50 per dose, 69% efficacy, 6 months protection) and infant mAb ($3.50 per dose, 77% efficacy, 5 months protection) showed that both interventions were cost-saving compared to status quo in around one-third of 133 LMICs, and had a cost per DALY averted below 0.5 times the national GDP per capita in the remaining LMICs. UNIVAC generated similar results to a separate model published by PATH. Cost-effectiveness results were most sensitive to changes in the price, efficacy and duration of protection of each strategy, and the rate (and cost) of RSV hospital admissions. Conclusions: Forthcoming RSV interventions (maternal vaccines and infant mAbs) are worth serious consideration in LMICs, but there is a good deal of uncertainty around several influential inputs, including intervention price, efficacy, and duration of protection. The UNIVAC decision-support model provides a framework for country teams to build consensus on data inputs, explore scenarios, and strengthen the local ownership and policy-relevance of results.

168,"Cost effectiveness of respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis: A critical and systematic review Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of infant hospitalization in the US. The economic burden of severe disease is substantial, including hospitalization costs and out-of-pocket expenses. RSV prophylaxis with either RSV immune globulin intravenous (RSV-IGIV) or palivizumab has been shown to be effective in reducing RSV-related hospitalizations. Motavizumab, a new enhanced-potency humanized RSV monoclonal antibody, is presently in clinical trials. RSV-IGIV and palivizumab are associated with high acquisition costs. Cost-effectiveness analyses are therefore of great importance in helping to determine who should receive RSV prophylaxis. Six studies have analysed the cost effectiveness of RSV-IGIV, 14 have analysed the cost effectiveness of palivizumab and five have analysed the cost effectiveness of both agents, two of which directly compared palivizumab with RSV-IGIV. The cost effectiveness of motavizumab has not been studied.Significant variation exists in the modelling used in these analyses. Many studies have examined short-term benefits such as reducing hospitalizations and associated costs, while fewer studies have examined long-term benefits such as QALYs or life-years gained. The payer and society have been the most common perspectives used. The endpoints examined varied and generally did not account for the potential impact of RSV prophylaxis on RSV-related complications such as asthma. While some studies have reported acceptable cost-effectiveness ratios for RSV prophylaxis, the majority failed to show cost savings or cost-effectiveness ratios below commonly accepted thresholds for either RSV-IGIV or palivizumab. Cost effectiveness of RSV prophylaxis tended to be more favourable in populations with specific risk factors, including premature infants 32 weeks gestational age, and infants or children aged <2 years with chronic lung disease or congenital heart disease.Comparing the results of economic analyses of the two agents suggests palivizumab may be the more cost-effective option in the population for which RSV prophylaxis is recommended. Over time, the acquisition cost of RSV prophylaxis agents, a major cost driver, may decrease, and more acceptable outcomes of economic analyses may result. Albeit important, the results of economic analyses are not the only tool that decision makers rely on, as population-specific risk factors, and efficacy and safety data must be considered when developing treatment guidelines and making clinical decisions.  2010 Adis Data Information BV.

169,"Respiratory syncytial virus hospitalization and mortality: Systematic review and meta-analysis Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major public health burden worldwide. We aimed to review the current literature on the incidence and mortality of severe RSV in children globally. Methods: Systematic literature review and meta-analysis of published data from 2000 onwards, reporting on burden of acute respiratory infection (ARI) due to RSV in children. Main outcomes were hospitalization for severe RSV-ARI and death. Results: Five thousand two hundred and seventy-four references were identified. Fifty-five studies were included from 32 countries. The global RSV-ARI hospitalization estimates, reported per 1,000 children per year (95% Credible Interval (CrI), were 4.37 (2.98, 6.42) among children <5 years, 19.19 (15.04, 24.48) among children <1 year, 20.01 (9.65, 41.31) among children <6 months and 63.85 (37.52, 109.70) among premature children <1 year. The RSV-ARI global case-fatality estimates, reported per 1,000 children, (95% Crl) were 6.21 (2.64, 13.73) among children <5 years, 6.60 (1.85, 16.93) for children <1 year, and 1.04 (0.17, 12.06) among preterm children <1 year. Conclusions: A substantial proportion of RSV-associated morbidity occurs in the first year of life, especially in children born prematurely. These data affirm the importance of RSV disease in the causation of hospitalization and as a significant contributor to pediatric mortality and further demonstrate gestational age as a critical determinant of disease severity. An important limitation of case-fatality ratios is the absence of individual patient characteristics of non-surviving patients. Moreover, case-fatality ratios cannot be translated to population-based mortality. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2017;52:556569.  2016 The Authors. Pediatric Pulmonology. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

170,"Epidemiology and clinical presentation of respiratory syncytial virus infection in a rural area of southern Mozambique Background. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in infants throughout most of the world, but little is known about RSV infection in Africa where LRTI are among the leading causes of infant and childhood death. Methods. The study took place in a rural district hospital in southern Mozambique between October, 1998, and May, 2000. From all children (n = 5635) <1 year of age presenting to an outpatient department with cough or nasal secretion and all children (n = 1307) <5 years of age admitted to hospital with a LRTI, a nasopharyngeal aspirate was collected and tested for RSV by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Abbott). Results. RSV infection was found in 8.6% of study infants in the outpatient department and 10.6% of admitted children with LRTI. Cases presented in predictable yearly outbreaks during the warm and rainy season. Lower respiratory tract involvement was frequent (59.7%). Cough, chest indrawing and increased respiratory rate were all independently related to RSV infection. Wheezing was infrequent. Bacterial coinfection (4.6%) and the case-fatality rate (3.4%) were low. Conclusions. There is a substantial burden of disease attributable to RSV infection in this rural African setting, with the highest incidence and severity occurring in young infants.

171,"The cost-effectiveness of palivizumab in infants with cystic fibrosis in the Canadian setting: A decision analysis model Background: Children with cystic fibrosis (CF) are at higher risk of severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, which can lead to a decline in lung function. A monoclonal antibody, palivizumab (PMB), effectively prevents RSV hospitalizations; however, the high cost of PMB, approximately C$10,000 per patient per RSV season, limits its widespread use. We assess the cost-effectiveness of PMB prophylaxis in CF children less than 2 y of age from the Canadian healthcare payer's perspective. Methods: In 2014, a Markov cohort model of CF disease and infant RSV infections in the Canadian setting was developed based on literature data. Infants were treated with monthly PMB injections over the 5-month RSV season. Lifetime health outcomes, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and 2013 $CAD costs, discounted at 5%, were estimated. Findings are summarized as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and budget impact. Deterministic sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess parameter uncertainty. Results: Implementation of a hypothetical Canadian RSV prophylaxis program resulted in ICERs of C$652,560 (all CF infants) and C$157,332 (high-risk CF infants) per QALY gained and an annual budget impact of C$1,400,000 (all CF infants) and C$285,000 (high-risk CF infants). The analysis was highly sensitive to the probability of severe RSV, the degree of lung deterioration following infection, and the cost of PMB. Conclusions: Our results suggest PMB is not cost-effective in Canada by commonly used thresholds. However, given the rarity of CF and relatively small budget impact, consideration may be given for the selective use of PMB for immunoprophylaxis of RSV in high-risk CF infants on a case-by-case scenario basis.

173,"Cost effectiveness of palivizumab for respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis in high-risk children: A UK analysis Objective: To assess the cost effectiveness of palivizumab (a preventative treatment against severe respiratory syncytial virus [RSV] infection) in children at high risk of hospitalisation, i.e. preterm infants 35 weeks gestation, children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and children with congenital heart disease (CHD). Methods: A decision tree model was developed employing data sources from the published literature, palivizumab clinical trials, official UK price/tariff lists and national population statistics. The comparator was no prophylaxis. The primary perspective of the study was that of the UK NHS. In a societal perspective scenario analysis, the future lost productivity of a child resulting from RSV-related mortality (indirect costs) was also included. The cost of administration of palivizumab, hospital care for RSV infections and the cost of asthma treatment were included. The analysis was based on a lifetime follow-up period in order to capture the impact of palivizumab on long-term morbidity and mortality resulting from an RSV infection. The primary efficacy outcome in the palivizumab clinical trials was the number of RSV hospitalisations avoided, which was extrapolated to effectiveness outcomes, i.e. number of life-years gained and number of QALYs. Costs and effects were discounted by 3.5%. Results: In preterm infants and children with BPD, prophylaxis with palivizumab compared with no prophylaxis had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 7042/QALY without discounting outcomes, increasing to 16 720/QALY after discounting. In babies with CHD, the use of palivizumab resulted in an ICER of 2427/QALY without discounting outcomes and 6664/QALY after discounting. One-way sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the model. A scenario analysis showed that the inclusion of indirect costs leads to further improvement in the cost-effectiveness outcomes for palivizumab. Conclusion: This study suggests that palivizumab prophylaxis against severe RSV infection in children at high risk may be cost effective from the NHS perspective (vs no prophylaxis), and that the positive clinical and economic benefits may persist beyond one RSV season.  2007 Adis Data Information BV.

174,"Cost-effectiveness of rosuvastatin versus ezetimibe/simvastatin in managing dyslipidemic patients in Mexico Objective: The purpose of this analysis was to study the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of oral rosuvastatin (RSV) 10mg/day vs. oral ezetimibe/simvastatin (E/S) 10/20mg/day in patients who met the LDL-C goals set out in the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP), Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) 2001 and 2004 guidelines, and the percent change in the atherogenic lipid profile in daily outpatient practice in a high specialty Hospital in Mexico City. Methods: From January 2004 to December 2005, outpatient medical records in the Cardiology Service were reviewed according to the following criteria: established dyslipidemia diagnosis, triglycerides and serum lipid measurements (TC, LDL-C, HDL-C) taken before receiving drug therapy with either oral RSV 10mg/day or oral E/S 10/20mg/day once daily, no other related lipid-lowering treatment administered, and lipid levels recorded at 8 weeks of treatment. A cost analysis was performed from an institutional perspective, using the exchange rate as of October 2006 of 10.9007 pesos/US dollar. A deterministic analysis was performed comparing treatment costs, proportion of patients achieving the ATP III goal, and the percentage decrease in LDL-C. In addition, a stochastic analysis was performed, considering the uncertainty around the estimations for mean cost and mean effectiveness estimations. Results: Using the ATP III 2001 criteria, the percentage of patients who reached the LDL-C goals was 81.4 for patients who received RSV, while the proportion for patients who received E/S was 58.4 (p<0.001). Results according to the ATP III 2004 criteria were: RSV, 46.4 vs. E/S, 31.4 (p0.04). The cost of a 1 reduction in LDL-C was $2.02 with RSV and $4.09 with E/S. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve showed that RSV might be more cost-effective than E/S, based on patients who achieved the 2004 goals. Conclusions: According to this exploratory, non-controlled retrospective analysis, it can be said that in daily clinical practice in high-cardiovascular- risk Mexican patients, treatment with oral RSV 10mg/day is more effective and less costly than treatment with the fixed-combination oral E/S 10/20mg/day.  2010 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved.

175,"Adjustable Algorithmic Tool for Assessing the Effectiveness of Maternal Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Vaccination on Infant Mortality in Developing Countries Acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) due to RSV is a common cause of global infant mortality, with most cases occurring in developing countries. Using data aggregated from priority countries as designated by the United States Agency for International Development's (USAID) Maternal Child Health and Nutrition (MCHN) program, we created an adjustable algorithmic tool for visualizing the effectiveness of candidate maternal RSV vaccination on infant mortality. Country-specific estimates for disease burden and case fatality rates were computed based on established data. Country-specific RSV-ALRI incidence rates for infants 0-5 months were scaled based on the reported incidence rates for children 0-59 months. Using in-hospital mortality rates and predetermined ""inflation factor,""we estimated the mortality of infants aged 0-5 months. Given implementation of a candidate maternal vaccination program, estimated reduction in infant RSV-ALRI incidence and mortality rates were calculated. User input is used to determine the coverage of the program and the efficacy of the vaccine. Using the generated algorithm, the overall reduction in infant mortality varied considerably depending on vaccine efficacy and distribution. Given a potential efficacy of 70% and a maternal distribution rate of 50% in every USAID MCHN priority country, annual RSV-ALRI-related infant mortality is estimated to be reduced by 14,862 cases. The absolute country-specific reduction is dependent on the number of live births; countries with the highest birth rates had the greatest impact on annual mortality reduction. The adjustable algorithm provides a standardized analytical tool in the evaluation of candidate maternal RSV vaccines. Ultimately, it can be used to guide public health initiatives, research funding, and policy implementation concerning the effectiveness of potential maternal RSV vaccination on reducing infant mortality.

Most clinical trials of vaccines (and treatments) that provide the evidence for current policy took place in the 1990s when rates of influenza-like illness (ILI) were twice those reported in recent years. The impact of influenza in the community is concealed by the variety of diagnoses appropriate to describing acute respiratory infections. Even in influenza virus active periods diagnoses of coryza, acute bronchitis, and otitis media made by general practitioners greatly exceed those of ILI. Respiratory syncytial virus presents particular problems because it often circulates at the same time as influenza. Thus, the diagnostic uncertainty and variety of respiratory pathogens causing similar illnesses are major confounders when estimating influenza vaccine effectiveness. Although meta-analyses have cast doubt on the wisdom of the universal vaccination of children, high-quality clinical trials have demonstrated efficacy against laboratory-confirmed infection. The distinction between this positive benefit and the wider issue of effectiveness against ILI in the community poses difficulties for determining policy. Mathematical models examining this issue are populated with data that are mostly estimated: therefore, the sensitivity analysis is critical and the conclusions are invariably accompanied by reservations. National policies based on demonstrated cost effectiveness are desirable, but these should not become a barrier to parents wishing to secure a benefit for their child or family, provided there is clear evidence of clinical efficacy.

177,"Burden of respiratory syncytial virus-associated lower respiratory infections in children in Spain from 2012 to 2018 Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRI) leading to infant hospitalization, morbidity and postnatal mortality in children younger than 5 years of age worldwide. The aim of this study was to collect data on hospitalizations for RSV-related ALRI in children in Spain from 2012 to 2018. Methods: We used the discharge reports from the Minimum Basic Data Set (MBDS) to retrospectively analyze hospital discharge data in children  14 years of age with a diagnosis of acute lower respiratory tract infection, based on the ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes, from 2012 to 2018. Results: A total of 190,474 children, 58.1% boys and 41.9% girls, were admitted for lower respiratory tract infections in Spain, including 118,731 cases of bronchiolitis, 53,972 cases of bronchitis, 3710 cases of RSV-positive pneumonia, and 14,061 cases of RSV infections. Of these, 92,426 children (48.5%) had laboratory-confirmed RSV infection. The mean case fatality rate was almost 6 times higher for pneumonia (0.6%) than for bronchiolitis (0.1%) or bronchitis (0.1%). A significant linear increase in the mean annual hospitalization rate for pneumonia of almost 15% per year was found, with no changes in the trend over the study period. Conclusions: RSV-related respiratory infections remain a leading cause of infant hospitalization in Spain. Effective antiviral treatments and preventive vaccines are urgently needed for the management of RSV infection in children, especially for those aged 6 to 12 months.

178,"Cost effectiveness of palivizumab for RSV prevention in high-risk children in the Netherlands Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common pathogen that is the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infections in young children. High-risk children are at risk of severe infection, which may require hospitalisation. RSV is also associated with a high risk for respiratory morbidity and mortality, which may have long-term clinical and economic consequences. Objective: To assess the cost effectiveness of palivizumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody, used as prevention against severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection requiring hospitalisation, in the indication of preterm infants and infants with preterm/bronchopulmonary dysplasia and in the second indication of children with congenital heart disease in the Dutch healthcare setting. Methods: A decision-tree model was used to estimate the cost effectiveness of palivizumab, used as a preventative treatment against severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, in high-risk groups of children in the Netherlands. The analysis was based on a lifetime follow-up period in order to capture the impact of palivizumab on long-term morbidity and mortality resulting from an RSV infection. Data sources included published literature, the palivizumab pivotal trials, official price/tariff lists and national population statistics. The study was conducted from the perspective of society in the Netherlands. Results: The use of palivizumab results in undiscounted incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of 12,728/QALY and 4,256/QALY in the in preterm/bronchopulmonary dysplasia and congenital heart disease indications, respectively. Inclusion of indirect costs leads to even more favourable cost-effectiveness outcomes. The study is limited by a number of conservative assumptions. It was assumed that palivizumab only affects the occurrence of RSV hospitalisation and does not influence the severity of the RSV infection. Another assumption was that international clinical trial data and data on utilities could be applied to the Dutch healthcare setting. Conclusion: Palivizumab provides cost-effective prophylaxis against RSV in high-risk infants. The use of palivizumab in these children results in positive short- and long-term health-economic benefits.  2009 Informa UK Ltd.

181,"Global burden of acute lower respiratory infections due to respiratory syncytial virus in young children: a systematic review and meta-analysis Background: The global burden of disease attributable to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) remains unknown. We aimed to estimate the global incidence of and mortality from episodes of acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) due to RSV in children younger than 5 years in 2005. Methods: We estimated the incidence of RSV-associated ALRI in children younger than 5 years, stratified by age, using data from a systematic review of studies published between January, 1995, and June, 2009, and ten unpublished population-based studies. We estimated possible boundaries for RSV-associated ALRI mortality by combining case fatality ratios with incidence estimates from hospital-based reports from published and unpublished studies and identifying studies with population-based data for RSV seasonality and monthly ALRI mortality. Findings: In 2005, an estimated 338 (95% CI 193-462) million new episodes of RSV-associated ALRI occurred worldwide in children younger than 5 years (22% of ALRI episodes), with at least 34 (28-43) million episodes representing severe RSV-associated ALRI necessitating hospital admission. We estimated that 66 000-199 000 children younger than 5 years died from RSV-associated ALRI in 2005, with 99% of these deaths occurring in developing countries. Incidence and mortality can vary substantially from year to year in any one setting. Interpretation: Globally, RSV is the most common cause of childhood ALRI and a major cause of admission to hospital as a result of severe ALRI. Mortality data suggest that RSV is an important cause of death in childhood from ALRI, after pneumococcal pneumonia and Haemophilus influenzae type b.

182,"Aetiology and risks factors associated with the fatal outcomes of childhood pneumonia among hospitalised children in the Philippines from 2008 to 2016: A case series study Objective Pneumonia remains the leading cause of hospitalisations and deaths among children aged <5 years. Diverse respiratory pathogens cause acute respiratory infections, including pneumonia. Here, we analysed viral and bacterial pathogens and risk factors associated with death of hospitalised children. Design A 9-year case series study. Setting Two secondary-care hospitals, one tertiary-care hospital and one research centre in the Philippines. Participants 5054 children aged <5 years hospitalised with severe pneumonia. Methods Nasopharyngeal swabs for virus identification, and venous blood samples for bacterial culture were collected. Demographic, clinical data and laboratory findings were collected at admission time. Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the factors associated with death. Results Of the enrolled patients, 57% (2876/5054) were males. The case fatality rate was 4.7% (238/5054), showing a decreasing trend during the study period (p<0.001). 55.0% of the patients who died were either moderately or severely underweight. Viruses were detected in 61.0% of the patients, with respiratory syncytial virus (27.0%) and rhinovirus (23.0%) being the most commonly detected viruses. In children aged 2-59 months, the risk factors significantly associated with death included age of 2-5 months, sensorial changes, severe malnutrition, grunting, central cyanosis, decreased breath sounds, tachypnoea, fever (38.5C), saturation of peripheral oxygen <90%, infiltration, consolidation and pleural effusion on chest radiograph. Among the pathogens, adenovirus type 7, seasonal influenza A (H1N1) and positive blood culture for bacteria were significantly associated with death. Similar patterns were observed between the death cases and the aforementioned factors in children aged <2 months. Conclusion Malnutrition was the most common factor associated with death and addressing this issue may decrease the case fatality rate. In addition, chest radiographic examination and oxygen saturation measurement should be promoted in all hospitalised patients with pneumonia as well as bacteria detection to identify patients who are at risk of death.

183,"Differing manifestations of respiratory syncytial virus-associated severe lower respiratory tract infections in human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected and uninfected children Background. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes increased morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised children. The outcome of RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in HIV-infected children, is less well described. Methods. Children from a prospective study evaluating the etiology of LRTI in African children, Soweto, South Africa, between March, 1997, and March, 1999, from whom RSV was isolated are included in this report. RSV was identified by mouse anti-RSV monoclonal fluorescent anti-body and subgroups were identified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Results. The prevalence of HIV infection was 14.6% (39 of 268) in children with RSV-associated severe LRTI. HIV-infected children were older than HIV-uninfected children [median, (25th to 75th quartiles)], 7.0 (3.0 to 12.0) vs. 4.0 (2.0 to 8.0) months, respectively, P = 0.003. Traditionally recognized risk factors for severe RSV disease were present in 23.1 and 24.5% of HIV-infected and -uninfected children respectively. HIV-infected children (92.3%) were more likely to present with pneumonia than HIV-uninfected children (68.6%, P < 0.002). Furthermore concurrent bacteremia (15.4% vs. 2.6%, P = 0.003), axillary temperatures of >38C (32.3% vs. 18.8%, P = 0.03) and leukocyte count > 15 000/mm(3) (41.0% vs. 25.3%, P = 0.04) occurred more often in HIV-infected than in HIV-uninfected children, respectively. The case fatality rate was also greater in HIV-infected than in HIV-uninfected children (7.6% vs. 1.7%, respectively; relative risk, 4.40; 95% confidence intervals, 1.02 to 18.92). Conclusions. HIV-infected children remain predisposed to developing RSV-associated severe LRTI beyond the first six months of life and are more likely to present with pneumonia, have greater evidence of bacterial coinfection and greater mortality than HIV-uninfected children.

184,"The risk of mortality among young children hospitalized for severe respiratory syncytial virus infection Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is the leading cause of childhood morbidity. Although also an important cause of childhood mortality worldwide, the impact of key risk factors has not been established. A systematic review of 34 articles reporting case fatality rates in young children hospitalized for severe RSV LRTI, according to the presence of underlying RSV risk factors, was conducted. The weighted mean case fatality rate was 1.2% (range, 0-8.3%; median, 0%; n = 10) among preterm infants; 5.2% (range, 2.0-37.0%; median, 5.9%; n = 7) among children with CHD; and 4.1% (range, 0-10.5%; median, 7.0%; n = 6) among children with BPD. Case fatality estimates among children not at high risk (n = 6) ranged from 0% to 1.5% (weighted mean, 0.2%; median, 0.0%).

185,"Intensive Care Unit Admission and Death Rates of Infants Admitted with Respiratory Syncytial Virus Lower Respiratory Tract Infection in Mexico Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common etiology for acute respiratory infection hospital admissions in young children. Case fatality rates for hospitalized patients range between 0% and 3.4%. Recent reports indicate that deaths associated with RSV are uncommon in developed countries. However, the role of this virus as a current cause of mortality in other countries requires further examination. Methods: Children with RSV infection admitted between May 2003 and December 2014 to a level 2 specialty hospital in Mexico were included in this analysis. Underlying risk factors, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and condition on discharge were assessed to determine the ICU admission and death rates associated to RSV infection. Results: We analyzed data of 1153 patients with RSV infection in whom information regarding underlying illnesses and discharge status was available. Sixty patients (5.2 %) were admitted to the ICU and 12 (1.04 %) died. Relevant underlying conditions were present in 320 (27.7%) patients. Infants with underlying respiratory disorders (excluding asthma) and a history of prematurity had high ICU admission rates (17.1% and 13.8%, respectively). Mortality rates were highest for infants with respiratory disease (excluding asthma) (7.3%), cardiovascular diseases (5.9%) and neurologic disorders (5.3%). The ICU admission and death rates were higher in infants <6 months of age than in other age groups. Conclusions: The ICU admission rate and mortality rate in Mexican infants hospitalized with RSV infection were 5.2% and 1%, respectively. Mortality rates were high in infants with respiratory, cardiovascular and neurologic disorders.

186,"The cost effectiveness of palivizumab: A systematic review of the evidence Objective: Palivizumab is a prophylactic therapy shown to reduce the number of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-related hospitalizations but has a high acquisition cost. The objective was to systematically examine the cost effectiveness of palivizumab in defined infant groups and identify important cost and outcome determinants. Methods: Literature searches of MedLine, the Cost-Effectiveness Analysis registry and the UK NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED) were conducted to identify economic evaluations of palivizumab compared to no prophylactic treatment for RSV prevention in any infant population. Study quality was evaluated using Quality of Health Economic Studies (QHES) criteria and results converted to 2009 CAN$ for comparison. Results: A total of 23 articles meeting inclusion criteria were identified, including 11 cost-utility analyses (CUAs) and 12 cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs). Quality of individual analyses was fairly high (range 60100, median 86). Results ranged from cost dominance for prophylaxis to $3,365,769/QALY depending on population, outcome measures, and input parameters. Base-case and sensitivity-analysis mortality rates varied between studies and influenced results. Conclusions: RSV prophylaxis with palivizumab is cost effective in specific groups of high-risk infants, especially those with multiple environmental risk factors. Cost-effectiveness estimates vary between populations and settings and are more positive in those at highest risk for RSV hospitalization. Limitations: Direct comparison of the published reports was limited by restriction to English language articles and the varied methodologies, input measures, and populations across the studies reviewed. Although reported currencies were converted to a common unit for comparison, this does not completely account for monetary and inflation differences.  2010 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

Methods: An existing decision tree model, designed using data from a large international clinical trial of palivizumab versus no prophylaxis, was updated to include Spanish observational hospitalisation data. The analysis was performed for preterm children born at or before 32 weeks gestational age, who are at high risk of developing severe RSV disease requiring hospitalisation. Data sources included published literature, official price/tariff lists and national population statistics. The primary perspective of the study was that of the Spanish National Health Service in 2006. Results: The base-case analysis included the direct medical costs associated with palivizumab prophylaxis and hospital care for RSV infections. Use of palivizumab produces an undiscounted incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 6,142 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), and a discounted ICER of 12,814/QALY.

This fourth publication covers the risk and burden of RSV infection in infants with congenital heart disease (CHD). Methods: A systematic review was undertaken for articles published between January 1, 1995 and December 31, 2015 across PubMed, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and Clinicaltrials.gov. Studies reporting data for hospital visits/admissions for RSV infection among children with CHD as well as studies reporting RSV-associated morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs were included. The focus was on children not receiving RSV prophylaxis. Study quality and strength of evidence (SOE) were graded using recognized criteria. Results: A total of 1325 studies were identified of which 38 were included. CHD, in particular hemodynamically significant CHD, is an independent predictor for RSV hospitalization (RSVH) (high SOE). RSVH rates were generally high in young children (<4 years) with CHD (various classifications), varying between 14 and 357/1000 (high SOE). Children (<6 years) with RSV infection spent 4.414 days in hospital, with up to 53% requiring intensive care (high SOE). Infants (<2 years) with CHD had a more severe course of RSVH than those without CHD (high SOE). Case fatality rates of up to 3% were associated with RSV infection in children with CHD (high SOE). RSV infection in the perioperative period of corrective surgery and nosocomial RSV infection in intensive care units also represent important causes of morbidity (moderate SOE). Conclusion: CHD poses a significant risk for RSVH and subsequent morbidity and mortality. RSV infection often complicates corrective heart surgery. To reduce the burden and improve outcomes, further research and specific studies are needed to determine the longer-term effects of severe RSV infection in young children with CHD. (Checchia P.A.)

190,"The cost effectiveness of palivizumab in term Inuit infants in the Eastern Canadian Arctic Introduction: Canadian, Inuit, full term infants have the highest rate of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection globally, which results in substantial costs associated hospitalisation. Methods: Decision-analytical techniques were used to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for palivizumab compared to no prophylaxis for Inuit infants of all gestational age. The time horizon was that of life-time follow-up, and costs and effectiveness were discounted at 5% per year. Costs (2007 CAD$) for palivizumab, hospitalisation (including medical evacuation, intensive care unit [ICU]), physician visits, and transportation were calculated based on the Canadian payer's perspective. Benefits on decreasing RSV hospitalisation were expressed as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) were conducted, varying: mortality rates, utilities, length of stay in hospital and ICU. Results: For all of Baffin Island infants (<1 year), the ICER was $39,435/QALY. However, when infants were grouped by age and area of residence, those residing in Iqaluit (<1 year) had an ICER of $152,145/QALY, while those residing in rural areas (outside of Iqaluit) had an ICER of $24,750/QALY. Prophylaxis was a dominant strategy (cost saving) for rural infants under 6 months of age, with the PSA demonstrating that it was dominant 98% of the time. Conclusions: The ICERs suggested that palivizumab is a cost-effective option for the prevention of RSV for Inuit infants on Baffin Island compared to no prophylaxis. Palivizumab is highly cost effective in Arctic infants <1 year of age specifically residing outside of Iqaluit and is a dominant strategy for those under 6 months of age in rural areas. However, palivizumab is not cost effective compared to no treatment for infants of all ages residing in Iqaluit.  2009 Informa UK Ltd.

Probabilistic sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the model. The study is limited by a number of conservative assumptions. It was assumed that palivizumab only affects the occurrence of RSV hospitalisation and does not influence the severity of the RSV infection. Another assumption was that international clinical trial data and data on utilities could be applied to the German healthcare setting. Conclusion: This analysis showed that palivizumab represents a cost-effective means of prophylaxis against severe RSV infection requiring hospitalisation in infants with haemodynamically significant CHD.  2009 Informa UK Ltd.

192,"Cost utility of palivizumab prophylaxis among pre-term infants in the United States: A national policy perspective Objective: The cost-effectiveness of palivizumab has previously been reported among certain guideline-eligible, high-risk premature infants in Medicaid. Because guideline authorities base decisions on a national perspective, the economic model of palivizumab was adapted to include all infants, that is, public and privately insured patients (60 of palivizumab use is public, 40% is private). Methods: This study examined four groups of premature infants without chronic lung disease of prematurity or congenital heart disease: (1) <32 weeks gestational age (wGA) and 6 months chronologic age (CA); (2) 32-34 wGA, 3 months CA, with 2009 American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) risk factors (RFs); (3) 32-35 wGA, 6 months CA, with 2006 AAP RFs; and (4) 32-35 wGA, 6 months CA, with 1 RF. An average estimate was used between public and private payors for (1) background rates of respiratory syncytial virus hospitalization (RSV-H), (2) direct medical costs associated with RSV-H, and (3) cost of palivizumab. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) are reported in cost per quality-Adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: Palivizumab saved costs and improved QALYs among infants <32 wGA. Palivizumab was cost-effective in infants 32-34 wGA with 2009 AAP RFs ($44,774 per QALY) and in infants 32-35 wGA with 2006 AAP RFs ($79,477 per QALY). The ICER for infants 32-35 wGA with 1 RF was $464,476 per QALY. Influential variables in the sensitivity analysis included background rate of RSV-H and cost and efficacy of palivizumab. Limitations: The results are not generalizable to populations outside of the US. The model did not examine all RFs. The wholesale acquisition cost was used as a payment benchmark; actual price paid by end providers varies. Conclusions: From a national policy perspective, palivizumab remained cost-effective for publically and commercially insured, guideline-eligible, high-risk premature infants. Palivizumab was not cost-effective in infants of 32-35 wGA with 1 RF.  2012 Informa UK Ltd. (Mahadevia P.J., mahadeviap@medimmune.com; Masaquel A.S.)

193,"Mortality from Respiratory Syncytial Virus in Children under 2 Years of Age: A Prospective Community Cohort Study in Rural Maharashtra, India Background: Although respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important viral cause of lower respiratory tract infection deaths in infants, there are few data on infant community deaths caused by RSV. Methods: This was an active surveillance of children younger than 2 years of age in 93 villages, 5 primary health centers, and 3 hospitals serving these villages. Village health workers and counselors at the health facilities monitored all lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in consented subjects. Children with severe, or very severe LRTIs and all who died, had nasopharyngeal swabs collected for detection of RSV by molecular methods. Results: In the 12 134 subjects, there were 2064 episodes of severe LRTIs and 1732 of very severe LRTIs, of which 271 and 195, respectively, had RSV. Fifteen of 16 (94%) children with RSV died of LRTIs, 14 in the community and 1 in the hospital. The case fatality ratios for severe RSV LRTIs in the first 6 months of life were 3/52 (7.1%) and 1/36 (2.8%) in the community and hospital, respectively. Of those with very severe LRTIs in the community, 17.6% died. There were no very severe RSV LRTI hospital deaths. The adjusted RSV LRTI mortality rates ranged from 1.0 to 3.0/1000 child-years (CY) overall, and 2.0 to 6.1/1000 CY, accounting for 20% of the LRTI deaths and 10% of the postneonatal infant mortality. Conclusions: Community deaths from RSV account for the majority of RSV LRTI deaths, and efforts at prevention should be preferentially directed at populations where access to care is limited.

194,"Severe Acute Respiratory Infections With Influenza and Noninfluenza Respiratory Viruses: Yemen, 2011-2016 In 2010, Yemen started the surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARIs) by establishing 2 sentinel sites in Sana'a and Aden city. This study aims to determine the proportions of influenza and noninfluenza viruses among SARI patients and to determine the severity of SARI and its associated factors. The data of SARI patients who were admitted to SARI surveillance sites at Al Johory hospital in Sana'a and Al Wahdah hospital in Aden city during the period 2011-2016 were analyzed. The proportions of positive influenza viruses (type A, B) and noninfluenza viruses (respiratory syncytial, adenovirus, human parainfluenza, and human metapneumovirus), intensive care unit (ICU) admission rate, and fatality rate among SARI patients were calculated. A total of 1811 of SARI patients were admitted during 2011-2016. Of those, 78% were <15 years old. A total of 89 (5%) patients had influenza viruses and 655 (36%) had noninfluenza viruses. The overall ICU admission rate was 40% and the case-fatality rate was 8%. Infection by influenza type (A, B) and mixed (adenovirus, human parainfluenza) was significantly associated with lower ICU admission. Age <15 years old, infection with influenza B, pre-existence of chronic diseases, and admission to Aden site were significantly associated with higher fatality rate among patients. In conclusion; SARI patients in Yemen had a high ICU admission and case-fatality rates. Influenza type B, chronic diseases, and admission to Aden site are associated with higher fatality rate. Expanding surveillance sites and panel of laboratory tests to involve other pathogens will help to provide accurate diagnosis for SARI etiology and give more comprehensive picture. Training staff for SARI case management will help to reduce severe outcomes. (Al Amad M.A.; Al Serouri A.A.) Yemen-Field Epidemiology Training Program, Yemen. , (Al Mahaqri A.A.)

195,"The cost effectiveness of palivizumab in congenital heart disease: A review of the current evidence Objective: To review and summarize the literature concerning the cost-effectiveness of palivizumab compared to no prophylaxis in infants and young children with congenital heart disease (CHD). Methods: A systematic literature search (MEDLINE to March 2012, limited to English language) identified studies that examined the cost-effectiveness of palivizumab in CHD populations. The quality of each study was assigned a quality score of 1-100 based on the Quality of Health Economic Studies (QHES) instrument. Results: Ten studies were identified through the search strategy, of which four principally addressed the research question and six additional articles examined CHD in conjunction with other high-risk indications for palivizumab in their economic analyses. QHES for the studies ranged from 58-100, with a median score of 93 (76 for principal articles, 94 for secondary analyses). Cost-utility analyses, which evaluated costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), showed favorable results in five analyses (range $10,329-$16,648 per QALY), while the other two suggested no cost-effectiveness ($146,061 and $169,971 per QALY). Of three cost-effectiveness analyses, which assessed costs per hospital admission prevented (HAP), two concluded that the drug was not cost-effective ($16,216/day of hospitalization prevented and $868,296/HAP), while one did not interpret the final result ($43,561/HAP). Limitations: Significant variance exists across study characteristics, analytic models utilized, duration of RSV seasons assessed, primary outcome measures evaluated, sensitivity analyses conducted, and other model assumptions. Further, it was difficult to obtain true CHD-based quality scores for the studies that analyzed more than one indication. Conclusions: The findings of this review currently remain inconclusive. Although a favorable trend was identified in the cost-utility analyses, additional rigorously conducted studies are necessary to better estimate the cost-effectiveness of palivizumab for CHD infants in clinical practice.  2013 Informa UK Ltd.

196,"Burden of respiratory syncytial virus disease and mortality risk factors in Argentina: 18 years of active surveillance in a children's hospital Background: Respiratory syncytial virus is the leading cause of acute lower respiratory infection in children. We aimed to describe the clinicalepidemiologic pattern and risk factors for mortality associated with RSV infection. Methods: This is a prospective, cross-sectional study of acute lower respiratory infection in children admitted to the Children's Hospital during 2000 to 2017. Viral diagnosis was made by fluorescent antibody techniques or real-time-polymerase chain reaction. We compared clinical-epidemiologic characteristics of RSV infection in nonfatal versus fatal cases. Multiple logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of mortality. Results: Of 15,451 patients with acute lower respiratory infection, 13,033 were tested for respiratory viruses and 5831 (45%) were positive: RSV 81.3% (4738), influenza 7.6% (440), parainfluenza 6.9% (402) and adenovirus 4.3% (251). RSV had a seasonal epidemic pattern coinciding with months of lowest average temperature. RSV cases show a case fatality rate of 1.7% (82/4687). Fatal cases had a higher proportion of prematurity (P < 0.01), perinatal respiratory history (P < 0.01), malnourishment (P < 0.01), congenital heart disease (P < 0.01), chronic neurologic disease (P < 0.01) and pneumonia at clinical presentation (P = 0.014). No significant difference between genders was observed. Most deaths occurred among children who had complications: Respiratory distress (80.5%), nosocomial infections (45.7%), sepsis (31.7%) and atelectasis (13.4%). Independent predictors of RSV mortality were moderate-to-severe malnourishment, odds ratio (OR): 3.69 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.98-6.87; P < 0.0001]; chronic neurologic disease, OR: 4.14 (95% CI: 2.12-8.08; P < 0.0001); congenital heart disease, OR: 4.18 (95% CI: 2.39-7.32; P< 0.0001); and the age less than 6 months, OR: 1.99 (95% CI: 1.24-3.18; P = 0.004). Conclusions: RSV showed an epidemic pattern affecting mostly young children. Malnourishment, chronic neurologic disease, congenital heart disease and the age less than 6 months were the independent risk factors for RSV mortality.

197,"Cost effectiveness of a protocol using palivizumab in preterm infants Objective: The main objective was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of protocol use of palivizumab in premature established by consensus in our Hospital comparing it based on the recommendations of various Scientific Societies. As a secondary objective risk factors and severity of hospitalized patients attending the established protocol in our Hospital were analyzed. Methods: The study period was 4 seasons with the expanded protocol (retrospective data) versus 2 with restricted or agreed protocol (prospective data). The perspective of the study was the Health System, including the costs of hospitalization and palivizumab our center. The calculation of the effectiveness was determined with the admission rate of premature patients stratified by weeks of gestational age <29, <32; and <35. For the analysis of risk factors and severity in patients admitted seasons with the new protocol are collected prospectively clinical data and environmental and social factors. Results: In the range of gestational age <29 years old and <32 greater effectiveness of the extended protocol was not demonstrated against the consensus. Only more effective for EG <35 in the accumulated data and comparing seasons 12/13 and 08/09 to 13/14 for individual data was observed. This range has an associated incremental cost effectiveness ratio of  53 250,07 (range:  14 793,39 to  90 446,47 for singles data and  50 525,53 ( 28 688.22 to  211 575,65) for accumulated. The establishment of this protocol in our center meant an average saving per season  169 911,51. A cost-effectiveness of the extended protocol appropriate relationship is found if the cost of palivizumab per patient was less than  1 206,67 (calculated for maximum use of the vial) and a higher rate of hospitalization of 9.21%.

Certain subpopulations of children are at greatest risk for serious disease. However, previously healthy children also may become critically ill. In the clinic or the intensive care unit, children with RSV pose the challenge of how to treat a disease when evidence to support therapeutic options is severely limited. Prophylaxis is an option for certain children, although many do not qualify. RSV has been implicated in continued wheezing and the subsequent development of asthma. While evidence for this implication is still being sought, researchers are working on finding new ways to treat and prevent RSV.  2009 National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners.

199,"Estimates of the national burden of respiratory syncytial virus in Kenyan children aged under 5 years, 20102018 Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is among the leading childhood causes of viral pneumonia worldwide. Establishing RSV-associated morbidity and mortality is important in informing the development, delivery strategies, and evaluation of interventions. Methods: Using data collected during 20102018 from base regions (population-based surveillance studies in western Kenya and the Kilifi Health and Demographic Surveillance Study), we estimated age-specific rates of acute respiratory illness (ARI), severe acute respiratory illness (SARIdefined as hospitalization with cough or difficulty breathing with onset within the past 10 days), and SARI-associated deaths. We extrapolated the rates from the base regions to other regions of Kenya, while adjusting for risk factors of ARI and healthcare seeking behavior, and finally applied the proportions of RSV-positive cases identified from various sentinel and study facilities to the rates to obtain regional age-specific rates of RSV-associated outpatient and non-medically attended ARI and hospitalized SARI and severe ARI that was not hospitalized (non-hospitalized SARI). We applied age-specific RSV case fatality ratios to SARI to obtain estimates of RSV-associated in- and out-of-hospital deaths. Results: Among Kenyan children aged < 5 years, the estimated annual incidence of outpatient and non-medically attended RSV-associated ARI was 206 (95% credible interval, CI; 186229) and 226 (95% CI; 204252) per 1000 children, respectively. The estimated annual rates of hospitalized and non-hospitalized RSV-associated SARI were 349 (95% CI; 303404) and 1077 (95% CI; 9341247) per 100,000 children respectively. The estimated annual number of in- and out-of-hospital deaths associated with RSV infection in Kenya were 539 (95% CI; 420779) and 1921 (95% CI; 14952774), respectively. Children aged < 6 months had the highest burden of RSV-associated severe disease: 2075 (95% CI; 18182394) and 44 (95% CI 2571) cases per 100,000 children for hospitalized SARI and in-hospital deaths, respectively. Conclusions: Our findings suggest a substantial disease burden due to RSV infection, particularly among younger children. Prioritizing development and use of maternal vaccines and affordable long-lasting monoclonal antibodies could help reduce this burden. (Nyawanda B.O., oteebryan@gmail.com; Otieno N.A.; Bigogo G.)

200,"Incidence and clinical features of hospitalization because of respiratory syncytial virus lower respiratory illness among children less than two years of age in a rural Asian setting Background. Lower respiratory illness is the leading cause of child death in the developing world. Despite this few reports on respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory illness disease burden exist from rural areas of the developing world, and none exist for Indonesia. Methods. We evaluated children living in any of 83 villages on Lombok Island, Indonesia who were 2 years of age when hospitalized for severe lower respiratory illness during 2000 and 2001. All hospitals on Lombok were included in the evaluation. We obtained the number of births and deaths that occurred within the study villages and time frame, allowing for incidence determination. Results. Of 2677 children hospitalized for severe lower respiratory illness whose RSV status was determined, 23% had a positive test; this percentage varied from 50% at the end of the rainy season to 0% shortly before the start of the rainy season. Among children 2 years of age, the confirmed and estimated incidences of severe RSV lower respiratory illness hospitalization were 10 and 14 per 1000 child-years, respectively; values for children <1 year of age were 17 and 25 per 1000 child-years. The confirmed casefatality percentage among RSV-positive cases was 1.9%; however, 84% of children who died were dead before RSV status could be determined, suggesting the actual case fatality percentage was higher. Conclusions. Lombok has a large burden of severe childhood RSV lower respiratory illness, and death occurs frequently. Novel RSV vaccines thus could have a substantial positive impact on lower respiratory illness morbidity and mortality. (Djelantik I.G.G.; Widjaya A.; Linehan M.; Moniaga V.) Prog.

201,"The epidemiology and clinical characteristics of young children hospitalized with respiratory syncytial virus infections in Guatemala (2007-2010) Background: There have been few population-based studies from Central America on respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections in young children. We report population-based incidence rates and describe epidemiological and clinical characteristics of children <5 years old hospitalized with RSV infections in Guatemala. Methods: Prospective, active hospital-based surveillance for acute respiratory infections in children <5 years old was conducted at 3 hospitals in Guatemala from November 2007 through July 2010. RSV hospitalization rates were calculated for areas where the catchment population could be defined. Comparisons were made between children who were RSV-positive and RSV-negative. Results: RSV was detected in 549 (25%) of enrolled children. Overall, annual rates of RSV hospitalizations ranged from 5.9 to 45.9 and 2.0 to 13.7 per 1000 children <1 year old and <5 years old, respectively, but varied by location and calendar year. Rates generally decreased with age - children <6 months had rates up to 30 times higher than older children, but children >12 months old still had rates up to 5.5 per 1000 per year and accounted for 42% of deaths. Children with RSV infections were more likely to have signs of respiratory distress (85% versus 63%, P< 0.001) compared with those without RSV infections, but case fatality ratios were similar (3-4%). Conclusions: The large burden and severity of RSV infections in young Guatemalan children is similar in magnitude and age distribution to RSV disease burdens found in other developing countries and suggests that this population would benefit from prevention strategies, including vaccines against RSV that are currently under development.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the major causative organism associated with acute lower respiratory tract infections in children.The objective of this study was to describe the clinical and epidemiological pattern of RSV and identify risk factors for RSV infection.Population and Methods. Prospective, cohort study on patients hospitalized due to acute lower respiratory tract infection at Hospital de Ninos Ricardo Gutierrez between March and November throughout the 2000-2013 period. The virological diagnosis of RSV, adenovirus, influenza and parainfluenza was performed by indirect immunofluorescence using nasopharyngeal aspirates.Results. A total of 12 555 children were included, 38.2% (4798) had virus rescued from samples. RSV accounted for 81.8% of cases (3924/4798) with no significant annual variations (71.2- 88.1) and with an epidemic seasonal pattern (May through July); RSV was followed by influenza (7.6%), parainfluenza (5.9%), and adenovirus (4.7%).The median age of patients with RSV rescue (3924) was 7 months old (0-214 months old), while 74.2% were younger than 1 year old, 43.1% were younger than 6 months old, 56.5% were males and the most common clinical presentation was bronchiolitis (60.7%). Comorbidities were observed in 41.6% of cases. The most common comorbidities were chronic respiratory disease (74%), congenital heart disease (14%), and chronic neurological disease (10.2%).Complications occurred in 25% of cases. The case fatality rate was 1.9% (74/3888). Independent predictors of RSV infection were age <3 months old (OR: 2.8 [2.14-3.67], p < 0.01), clinical presentation of bronchiolitis (OR: 1.54 [1.32-1.79], p < 0.01), and hypoxemia at the time of admission (OR: 1.84 [1.42-2.37], p < 0.01).Conclusions.

203,"Hospitalization costs and length of stay of Japanese children with respiratory syncytial virus: A structural equation modeling approach Background: This study sought to identify factors that impact the total health care costs associated with hospitalization of young Japanese children with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Methods: Children admitted between April 2014 and March 2015 with at least a confirmed diagnosis of RSV and 2 days of hospital stay were considered for inclusion. Data analyses of hospital claims were performed using a structural equation modeling approach. Results: A total of 6811 Japanese inpatients (<5 years old) diagnosed with RSV were included. The average length of stay was 7.5 days with a mean total health care cost of US Dollars (USD) $3344 per hospitalization. Intensive care unit hospitalizations were associated with greater costs (USD +$4951) compared to routine hospitalizations. The highest procedure-related cost drivers were blood transfusions (USD +$6402) and tube feedings (USD +$3512). Conclusion: The economic burden of RSV-related infection hospitalizations in Japan is considerable. Efforts should be toward immunization and therapeutic treatment strategies that reduce severity, prevent, or reduce the duration of hospitalization.

205,"Respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia in the hospital setting: Length of stay, charges, and mortality Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important viral cause of lower respiratory tract infection in infants and young children worldwide. No vaccine against RSV is available, but prophylactic interventions have been shown to be safe and effective in clinical trials. Objectives: This retrospective analysis was conducted to examine the health and economic burden of hospitalization for RSV pneumonia. Methods: Nationally weighted hospital discharges for RSV pneumonia among children 4 years old and younger were analyzed by using the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project National Inpatient Sample. Results: In 1993, there were estimated to be 16,500 hospital discharges with RSV pneumonia, which increased to 19,700 and 20,800 in 1994 and 1995, respectively. Children less than 1 year of age accounted for over 70% of these discharges. Hospital charges (in 1998 dollars) for RSV pneumonia-associated episodes were $295,100,000 in 1993; $392,300,000 in 1994; and $295,800,000 in 1995. Conclusions: With inpatient charges of $300 to $400 million per year in the United States, the disease burden of RSV pneumonia is very high in terms of both morbidity and economic costs.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the most common pathogens involved in nosocomial infection in children. The aim of the study was to determine the impact of nosocomial RSV infection on mortality and pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) morbidity of ventilated children. Methods. This is a prospective observational cohort study of all children ventilated with RSV infection in a tertiaryreferral PICU over a 10-year period. Determinants of the relationship of nosocomial (PICU-acquired and hospital ward-acquired) RSV infection to mortality and PICU morbidity were adjusted for by performing multiple regression analysis. Results. Of 525 RSV-positive children ventilated on PICU during the ten-year study period, 38 (7.2%) acquired their RSV infection following PICU admission and 38 (7.2%) had acquired RSV in hospital. Ten (26%) children that acquired RSV on PICU died (RR 6.4, 95%CI 3.2-12.9) and 11 (29%) with hospital ward-acquired infection died (RR 9.8, 95%CI 5.1-18.9), compared to 18 (4%) with community-acquired RSV infection. Nosocomial RSV infection was significantly and independently associated with death which was more strongly predicted by immunodeficiency and congenital heart disease (P<0.01). Nosocomial RSV infection was the strongest predictor for morbidity as reflected in duration of ventilation and length of stay on PICU (P<0.01). Conclusion. Nosocomial RSV infection was independently associated with increased mortality and was the strongest predictor of duration of ventilation and length of stay in children on PICU. Decreasing nosocomial RSV infection would reduce deaths in ventilated children.  2012 EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA.

207,"Benign outcome of RSV infection in children with cancer Background. High case-fatality rates have been reported among adults who develop respiratory syncytical virus (RSV) infection while being treated for oncologic diseases, particularly after bone marrow transplantation. Previous reports of RSV infection among children with primary and acquired immunodeficiencies describe increased morbidity compared with that seen in immunocompetent children, but there have been few reports describing the outcome of RSV infection specifically among pediatric oncology patients. Methods. We retrospectively reviewed the charts of all children being treated by the Pediatric Oncology Service at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center who had positive tests for RSV between the Fall of 1994 and the Spring of 1998. Patients on the BMT Service were excluded from this analysis. Results. Eighteen RSV infections were identified among pediatric oncology patients, who were being treated with aggressive, predominantly alkylator-based chemotherapy for a variety of oncologic diagnoses. Nine episodes of RSV infection (50%) were treated with specific antiviral therapy. Only one death less than 100 days from the diagnosis of RSV infection occurred among these 18 patients and was attributed to progressive leukemia. The remaining patients recovered fully, although three were readmitted with respiratory symptoms within two weeks of discharge. Seven patients had concurrent infection with other pathogenic organisms. Conclusions. In striking contrast with the outcome of RSV infection in adult oncology patients, there may be low mortality associated with RSV infection in pediatric oncology patients. It is possible that scheduled antineoplastic therapy need not be delayed for these patients when the diagnosis of RSV infection is made.  2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

208,"Respiratory syncytial virus infections in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients and other severely immunocompromised patients Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a single stranded RNA virus, causes yearly seasonal epidemics of upper and lower respiratory infections affecting, to various degrees, all age groups. In North America and Europe, these epidemics generally start in late October-early November, peak at the end of December through February, and then gradually fade away in the spring. It is well known that during these yearly epidemics RSV is the leading lower respiratory infection of children. By the time a child reaches 24 months of age, the chance of his or her having been infected with RSV is >95% [1]. Although less common than in children, RSV is also a pathogen of adults. Outbreaks in nursing homes have been well documented, with pneumonia developing in ~66% of patients [2]. Other groups of patients are at increased risk of severe RSV infections: those with underlying chronic lung diseases, congenital heart disease, prematurity, or those who are severely immunocompromised. RSV also is an increasingly well recognized and often fatal complication of patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Case fatality ratios in this patient population have been reported to exceed 70% [3]. This paper explores RSV pathology and pathogenesis, epidemiology and outcome, diagnosis, treatment, future studies, and recommendations. (DeVincenzo J.P.) Crippled Children's Found. Res.

209,"Severe Acute Respiratory Illness Deaths in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Role of Influenza: A Case Series From 8 Countries Background. Data on causes of death due to respiratory illness in Africa are limited. Methods. From January to April 2013, 28 African countries were invited to participate in a review of severe acute respiratory illness (SARI)-associated deaths identified from influenza surveillance during 2009-2012. Results. Twenty-three countries (82%) responded, 11 (48%) collect mortality data, and 8 provided data. Data were collected from 37 714 SARI cases, and 3091 (8.2%; range by country, 5.1%-25.9%) tested positive for influenza virus. There were 1073 deaths (2.8%; range by country, 0.1%-5.3%) reported, among which influenza virus was detected in 57 (5.3%). Case-fatality proportion (CFP) was higher among countries with systematic death reporting than among those with sporadic reporting. The influenza-associated CFP was 1.8% (57 of 3091), compared with 2.9% (1016 of 34 623) for influenza virus-negative cases (P <. 001). Among 834 deaths (77.7%) tested for other respiratory pathogens, rhinovirus (107 [12.8%]), adenovirus (64 [6.0%]), respiratory syncytial virus (60 [5.6%]), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (57 [5.3%]) were most commonly identified. Among 1073 deaths, 402 (37.5%) involved people aged 0-4 years, 462 (43.1%) involved people aged 5-49 years, and 209 (19.5%) involved people aged 50 years. Conclusions. Few African countries systematically collect data on outcomes of people hospitalized with respiratory illness. Stronger surveillance for deaths due to respiratory illness may identify risk groups for targeted vaccine use and other prevention strategies.

210,"Incidence of Hospitalization for Vaccine-Preventable Infections in Children Following Solid Organ Transplant and Associated Morbidity, Mortality, and Costs Importance: Pediatric transplant recipients are at risk for vaccine-preventable infections owing to immunosuppression, suboptimal response to vaccines before and after transplant, and potential underimmunization if transplant occurred early in life. However, the incidence and burden of illness from vaccine-preventable infections in this population is unknown. Objectives: To evaluate in pediatric solid organ transplant recipients the number of hospitalizations for vaccine-preventable infections in the first 5 years after transplant and to determine the associated morbidity, mortality, and costs. Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective cohort study from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2011, with 5 years of follow-up per participant (unless they died during the study period). The participants of this multicenter study through the Pediatric Health Information System were solid organ transplant recipients who were younger than 18 years at the time of transplant. Analysis began in July 2017. Exposures: Transplant. Main Outcomes and Measures: Hospitalizations for a vaccine-preventable infection during the first 5 years after transplant were ascertained using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision, clinical modification diagnosis codes. Data were collected on clinical care, outcomes, and costs during these hospitalizations. Results: Of 6980 transplant recipients identified, there were 3819 boys (54.7%), and the mean (SD) age at transplant was 8 (6.2) years. Overall, 1092 patients (15.6%) had a total of 1471 cases of vaccine-preventable infections. There were 187 of 1471 cases (12.7%) that occurred during transplant hospitalization. The case fatality rate was 1.7% for all infections. Excluding infections that occurred during transplant hospitalization (when all patients go to the intensive care unit), 213 of 1257 patients (17.0%) were hospitalized with a vaccine-preventable infection requiring intensive care. In multivariable analysis, age younger than 2 years at time of transplant and receipt of a lung, heart, intestine, or multivisceral organ were positively associated with increased risk of a hospitalization from a vaccine-preventable infection.Transplant hospitalizations complicated by vaccine-preventable infections were 120498 more expensive (median cost) than transplant hospitalizations not complicated by vaccine-preventable infections. Conclusions and Relevance: Hospitalization for vaccine-preventable infections occurred in more than 15% of solid organ transplant recipients in the first 5 years after transplant at a rate of up to 87 times higher than in the general population. There was significant morbidity, mortality, and costs from these infections, demonstrating the importance of immunizing all transplant candidates and recipients. Further research on improving immunization delivery, preventing nosocomial infections, and monitoring response to vaccines in the transplant population is needed.

211,"Viral and atypical bacterial aetiologies of infection in hospitalised patients admitted with clinical suspicion of influenza in Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia Background: Influenza constitutes a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. There is limited information about the aetiology of infection presenting clinically as influenza in hospitalised adults and children in South-East Asia. Such data are important for future management of respiratory infections. Objectives: To describe the aetiology of infection presenting clinically as influenza in those hospitalised in South-East Asia. Methods: Respiratory specimens archived from July 2008 to June 2009 from patients hospitalised with suspected influenza from Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam were tested for respiratory viruses and atypical bacteria by polymerase chain reaction. Results: A total of 1222 patients' samples were tested. Of 1222, 776 patients (635%) were under the age of 5. Viruses detected included rhinoviruses in 229 of 1222 patients (187%), bocaviruses in 200 (164%), respiratory syncytial viruses in 144 (118%), parainfluenza viruses in 140 (115%; PIV1: 32; PIV2: 12; PIV3: 71; PIV4: 25), adenovirus in 102 (84%), influenza viruses in 93 (76%; influenza A: 77; influenza B: 16) and coronaviruses in 23 (18%; OC43: 14; E229: 9). Bacterial pathogens were Mycoplasma pneumoniae (n = 33, 27%), Chlamydophila psittaci (n = 2), C. pneumoniae (n = 1), Bordetella pertussis (n = 1) and Legionella pneumophila (n = 2). Overall, in-hospital case fatality rate was 29 of 1222 (24%). Conclusion: Respiratory viruses were the most commonly detected pathogens in patients hospitalised with a clinical suspicion of influenza. Rhinovirus was the most frequently detected virus, and M. pneumoniae, the most common atypical bacterium. The low number of detected influenza viruses demonstrates a low benefit for empirical oseltamivir therapy, unless during an influenza outbreak.

212,"Global disease burden estimates of respiratory syncytial virus-associated acute respiratory infection in older adults in 2015: A systematic review and meta-analysis Respiratory syncytial virus.associated acute respiratory infection (RSV-ARI) constitutes a substantial disease burden in older adults aged 65 years. We aimed to identify all studies worldwide investigating the disease burden of RSV-ARI in this population. We estimated the community incidence, hospitalization rate, and in-hospital case-fatality ratio (hCFR) of RSV-ARI in older adults, stratified by industrialized and developing regions, using data from a systematic review of studies published between January 1996 and April 2018 and 8 unpublished population-based studies. We applied these rate estimates to population estimates for 2015 to calculate the global and regional burdens in older adults with RSV-ARI in the community and in hospitals for that year. We estimated the number of in-hospital deaths due to RSV-ARI by combining hCFR data with hospital admission estimates from hospital-based studies. In 2015, there were about 1.5 million episodes (95% confidence interval [CI], .3 million.6.9 million) of RSV-ARI in older adults in industrialized countries (data for developing countries were missing), and of these, approximately 14.5% (214 000 episodes; 95% CI, 100 000.459 000) were admitted to hospitals. The global number of hospital admissions for RSV-ARI in older adults was estimated at 336 000 hospitalizations (uncertainty range [UR], 186 000.614 000). We further estimated about 14 000 in-hospital deaths (UR, 5000.50 000) related to RSV-ARI globally. The hospital admission rate and hCFR were higher for those aged .65 years than for those aged 50.64 years. The disease burden of RSV-ARI among older adults is substantial, with limited data from developing countries. Appropriate prevention and management strategies are needed to reduce this burden.

213,"Readmission with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection among graduates from a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit We evaluated the incidence of readmission with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection among the graduates of a regional Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), and characterized those who were rehospitalized. These data were used as a predictive tool to estimate the number of babies likely to suffer readmission with RSV for the year 2000 cohort. Using the published efficacies of palivizumab, the costs and benefits of protecting this cohort were assessed. Retrospective analysis of 2,507 NICU inpatient records from January 1, 1994-December 31, 1999 from the Royal Maternity Hospital, Belfast, were compared with data on positive RSV samples from 1,790 patients between January 1, 1995-December 31, 1999 from the Northern Ireland Regional Virus Laboratory. The analysis yielded 136 (7.6%) ex-NICU patients among the positive RSV samples over this 5-year period. Characteristic seasonal peaks of RSV infection with interseasonal variability were observed. Of those readmitted, 86.9% were hospitalized with RSV before their first birthday. A calculated readmission rate of 5.4% for all NICU graduates, and 6.4% for those 35 weeks, was found, leading to an expectation of 36 readmissions from the 668 NICU graduates in the year 2000 over the next 1-2 years, 20 of whom would be 35 weeks and 12 would be 32 weeks. A cost of 1.3 million would be required to protect the 35-week year 2000 cohort and prevent 11 readmissions. This equals 120,000 per admission prevented, or 28.2 patients treated to prevent 1 readmission. A readmission rate of 6.4% may differ from other studies, as it represents analysis of a greater number of RSV seasons. Using economic arguments alone, the cost of routine administration of Palivizumab to ex-NICU 35-week infants is prohibitive. A selective practice of immunizing those with chronic lung disease with a background of extreme prematurity over the November to March RSV season may be more cost-effective.  2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

To report the results of treating respiratory syncytial virus-associated respiratory failure with high frequency oscillatory ventilation as rescue therapy. Design. Retrospective case series. Setting. A pediatric intensive care unit in a tertiary academic medical center. Patients or participants. Nineteen of 74 (26%) patients admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit over 3 years for respiratory syncytial virus respiratory tract infection developed respiratory failure. Eleven were treated with conventional ventilation only (group 1) and 8 were treated with high frequency oscillatory ventilation when conventional ventilation failed (group 2). Interventions. Medical records were reviewed to assess risk factors for severe disease, duration of mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy, peak oxygenation index, length of stay, morbidities, and mortalities. Measurements and results. Group 2 had a longer duration of mechanical ventilation, oxygen therapy, length of stay, and a higher peak oxygenation index compared to group 1. Peak oxygenation index correlated positively with length of mechanical ventilation, length of oxygen therapy, and length of stay. Morbidities were minimal, and there were no mortalities. Conclusions. Rescue therapy with high frequency oscillatory ventilation was well-tolerated though the duration of therapy was prolonged. Further investigation of its role in pediatric respiratory syncytial virus-associated respiratory failure is needed.  2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd. (Baird J.S., jsbaird2@mac.com; Schleien C.L.)

215,"Influence of prior pneumococcal and influenza vaccination on outcomes of older adults with community-acquired pneumonia OBJECTIVES: To determine whether prior pneumococcal and seasonal influenza vaccination improves outcomes in older adults hospitalized for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). DESIGN: Prospective, observational, multicenter study. SETTING: Five public hospitals providing universal free care to the whole population in three Spanish regions. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 65 and older admitted to the hospital with CAP through the emergency department. MEASUREMENTS: Pneumococcal and influenza vaccination status. The primary study outcomes were intensive care unit (ICU) admission, length of hospital stay (LOS), and overall case-fatality rate. Outcome variables of individuals vaccinated with both vaccines were compared with outcomes of those who were unvaccinated. RESULTS: Two hundred thirty-eight individuals had received 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine and seasonal influenza vaccination and were compared with 195 unvaccinated individuals. No differences were found with respect to combined antibiotic therapy between groups (38.0% vs 39.7%; P=.80). Similar percentages of vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals required ICU admission (7.2% vs 8.2%; P=.69). Mean LOS was significantly shorter in vaccinated individuals (9.9 vs 12.4 days; P =.04). Overall case-fatality rates were similar in both groups (5.9% vs 5.1%; P=.73). After adjustment, LOS, risk of ICU admission, and overall case-fatality rate were not associated with prior pneumococcal and seasonal influenza vaccination. CONCLUSION: The clinical outcomes ofvaccinated older adults hospitalized with CAP were not better than those observed in unvaccinated individuals.  2011, Copyright the Authors.

216,"Respiratory syncytial virus disease burden in adults aged 60 years and older in high-income countries: A systematic literature review and meta-analysis Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-associated acute respiratory infection (ARI) is an underrecognized cause of illness in older adults. We conducted a systematic literature review and meta-analysis to estimate the RSV disease burden in adults 60 years in high-income countries. Methods: Data on RSV-ARI and hospitalization attack rates and in-hospital case fatality rates (hCFR) in adults 60 years from the United States, Canada, European countries, Japan, and South Korea were collected based on a systematic literature search (January 1, 2000November 3, 2021) or via other methods (citation search, unpublished studies cited by a previous meta-analysis, gray literature, and an RSV-specific abstract booklet). A random effects meta-analysis was performed on estimates from the included studies. Results: Twenty-one studies were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled estimates were 1.62% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.843.08) for RSV-ARI attack rate, 0.15% (95% CI: 0.090.22) for hospitalization attack rate, and 7.13% (95% CI: 5.409.36) for hCFR. In 2019, this would translate into approximately 5.2 million cases, 470,000 hospitalizations, and 33,000 in-hospital deaths in 60-year-old adults in high-income countries. Conclusions: RSV disease burden in adults aged 60 years in high-income countries is higher than previously estimated, highlighting the need for RSV prophylaxis in this age group.

218,"Predicting prolonged length of stay in hospitalized children with respiratory syncytial virus Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infections in children. This study aimed to predict the prolonged length of stay in children admitted to hospital with RSV. Methods: Children aged <2 years with RSV in the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) were included in the analyses. The primary outcome was prolonged length of stay (90th percentile). Logistic regression models were developed using data from 2016; internal validation was completed using a bootstrapped sample. Data from 2017 were used to validate out-of-sample discrimination and calibration of the models. Results: The sample included 9589 children; 1054 had prolonged length of stay (7 days). Children who were younger, transferred from another hospital, and required intubation during admission had a higher risk of prolonged length of stay. The prediction model included age, transport, intubation, comorbidities, hospital location, and teaching status. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.73, demonstrating good predictive ability. The model performed similarly in external validation. Conclusions: Variables that predict the prolonged length of stay for RSV include younger age, transport, intubation, comorbidities, hospital location, and teaching status. This can be used to predict children who will have a prolonged length of stay when hospitalized for RSV. Impact: There are no recommended treatments for RSV; medical care involves supportive treatment such as oxygen delivery, hydration, and antipyretics.The clinical course is difficult to predict, partially attributable to the supportive nature of care and the sparsity of evidence-based therapies for this population.A prediction model was developed, demonstrating variables that predict prolonged length of stay in RSV hospitalizations, including age, interhospital transport, intubation, comorbidities, hospital location, and teaching status.The model was developed with a sample size of 9589 that is representative of all hospitalizations in the United States.

219,"Fatality rates in published reports of RSV hospitalizations among high-risk and otherwise healthy children Objective: To review the fatalities among children hospitalized with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, and identify factors leading to a fatal outcome. Research design and methods: Review of literature identified from a structured search of PubMed (1966-2009) using the following Medical Subject Headings: respiratory syncytial virus infection; hospitalized; infants; and risk factors. Publications were restricted to: English language; full papers; inclusion of >10 subjects; children aged 18 years, hospitalization for RSV infection; and deaths reported. Case fatality rates were defined as number of deaths divided by number of children hospitalized for RSV and were calculated for each study. Results: Thirty-six studies met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Case fatality rates among children hospitalized for RSV ranged from 0 to 33. In general, studies showed that subgroups of high-risk children (chronic lung disease [CLD] 3.523, congenital heart disease [CHD] 237, and prematurity 06.1) had higher fatality rates than older or otherwise healthy children (consistently <1). Presence of severe underlying comorbidities such as neuromuscular disease, immunosuppression, and malignancies was associated with death among term and/or older (>1 year) children. Higher fatality rates were reported for infants receiving intensive unit care (1.18.6), extracorporeal life support (33) or for those who acquired nosocomial RSV infection (012.2). The majority of studies did not report cause of death and clinical details of the fatal cases were often not provided. Other limitations of this review include our search limits, the possibility of inherent bias in our methodology that could result in an under or over estimation of case-fatality rates, and potential publication bias. Conclusions: Children at high risk for RSV (CLD, CHD and prematurity), those with severe underlying comorbidities, or those with nosocomial RSV appear to be at increased risk for death after RSV hospitalization. More data are needed on cause of death and how much is directly attributable to RSV.  2010 Informa UK Ltd. All rights reserved.

220,"Clinical profile of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) bronchiolitis in the intensive care unit at a tertiary care hospital RSV (Respiratory Syncytial Virus) is the most common cause of bronchiolitis among new-borns worldwide. Although many risk factors for RSV infections in newborns have been proposed, there is still a need to further investigate the profile of RSV positive children who required ICU admission to be able to better identify children at risk. Moreover, increasing evidences suggest that genetic variations of the host response can influence the outcome of some infectious diseases such as RSV-induced bronchiolitis. In this study, we have investigated the risk factors associated with RSV infection in Saudi children admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of a tertiary university hospital. We have noticed that prematurity is associated with increased severity of RSV infection. Thirty seven percent of the infants admitted in the PICU were found to be of premature birth. Moreover, children with pulmonary pathology and cardio-vascular abnormalities were also more prone to RSV infection. The clinical characteristics of these patients and the over-all outcome of the PICU admission were discussed. The seasonality of RSV admissions in the PICU at a teaching tertiary care hospital was also reported herein. (Al-Muhsen S.Z.)

221,"Types of infectious outbreaks and their impact in elderly care facilities: A review of the literature Background: Infectious outbreaks in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) tend to have a significant impact on infection rates and mortality rates of the residents. 299 Objectives: this review aimed to update the information on pathogens identified in such outbreaks and to try to explore indicators that reflect the impact of outbreaks among residents and health care workers (HCWs). Methods: MEDLINE (1966-2008) was used to identify outbreaks using the following thesaurus terms: 'Cross-Infection', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Urinary-Tract Infections' and 'Blood-Borne Pathogens'. Elderly care facilities were identified with the following thesaurus terms: 'Long-Term Care', 'Assisted-Living Facilities', 'Homes for the Aged' and 'Nursing Homes'. Age category was limited using 'Aged'. Results: thirty-seven pathogens were associated with 206 outbreaks. The largest number of reported outbreaks by a single pathogen involved the influenza virus, followed by noroviruses. Among residents, the highest median attack rate for respiratory infection outbreaks was caused by Chlamydia pneumoniae (46%), followed by respiratory syncytial virus (40%). In gastrointestinal tract infection outbreaks, high median attack rates were caused by Clostridium perfringens (48%) and noroviruses (45%). Outbreaks with high median case fatality rates were caused by Group A Streptococci (50%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (44%). High median attack rates for HCWs were caused by C. pneumoniae (41%), noroviruses (42%) and scabies (36%). Conclusion: a variety of infectious agents were identified as the cause of outbreaks in the elderly and HCWs in LTCFs. Attack rates and case fatality rates are useful indicators for setting priorities for education and prevention of the outbreaks.  The Author 2010.

222,"Clinical impact and direct costs of nosocomial respiratory syncytial virus infections in the neonatal intensive care unit Background: Nosocomial infections are a leading cause of morbidity, costs, and mortality in preterm newborns. Most reports regarding nosocomial infections in neonatal intensive care units (NICU) are focused on bacterial infections and there is limited information regarding the impact of nosocomial viruses. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of nosocomial respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections in a NICU. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort design from a NICU in a general hospital in Mexico. We included 24 newborn infants with nosocomial RSV infection and 24 infants without RSV matched by gestational age, birth weight, and the period of time of hospitalization. Results: Infants with nosocomial RSV infection had longer hospitalization duration (median 24 days vs. 13 days; P =.05), increased antibiotic use (45.8% vs. 8.3%; P =.003), more mechanical ventilation requirement (54.2% vs. 0.4%; P <.001), more frequent nosocomial infections (45.8% vs. 0%; P <.001), and higher hospitalization direct costs (median 3,587.20 USD vs. 1,123.60 USD; P =.001) after nosocomial RSV detection. Conclusions: Nosocomial RSV infections are associated to a significant increase of costs in infants hospitalized in the NICU. Evaluation of interventions that may reduce the incidence of nosocomial RSV infections in this setting is warranted.

223,"Early-life respiratory syncytial virus lower respiratory tract infection in a South African birth cohort: epidemiology and effect on lung health Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in children. Early-life RSV LRTI might affect long-term health but there are few data from low-income and middle-income countries. We investigated the epidemiology and effect of early-life RSV LRTI on lung health in a South African birth cohort. Methods: We conducted the Drakenstein Child Health Study (DCHS), an ongoing birth cohort longitudinal study in the Western Cape province, South Africa. We enrolled pregnant women aged 18 years or older during their second trimester of pregnancy at two public health clinics. We followed up study children from birth to 2 years. The primary outcome of the study was LRTI and RSV LRTI. LRTI and wheezing episodes were identified through active surveillance; respiratory samples were tested for RSV and other pathogens. Wheezing was longitudinally identified by caregiver report and ascertainment at health facilities. Lung function was measured from 6 weeks to 2 years. We analysed the associations between RSV LRTI and subsequent LRTI, wheezing, and lung function using generalised estimating equations and mixed-effects linear regression. Findings: We enrolled 1137 mothers between March 5, 2012, and March 31, 2015. Among their 1143 infants, accruing 2093 child-years of follow-up, there were 851 cases of LRTI (incidence 041 episodes per child-year, 95% CI 038043). Admission to hospital owing to LRTI occurred in 169 (20%) cases (incidence 008 episodes per child-year, 007009), with a case-fatality ratio of 05%. RSV was detected in 164 (21%) of 785 LRTI events with a specimen available for qPCR, an incidence of 008 episodes per child-year (007009); highest at age 06 months (015 episodes per child-year, 012019). Children with a first RSV LRTI were three times as likely to develop recurrent LRTI compared with those with non-RSV LRTI (032 [022048] vs 010 [007 016] episodes per child-year; p<00001), particularly following hospitalised RSV LRTI. RSV LRTI and hospitalisation for all-cause LRTI were independently associated with recurrent wheezing (adjusted incident rate ratio 141, 95% CI 125159, for RSV LRTI and 148, 130168, for hospitalisation). LRTI or recurrent LRTI was associated with impaired lung function, but a similar outcome was observed following RSV LRTI or non-RSV LRTI. All-cause LRTI was associated with an average 3% higher respiratory rate (95% CI 001006; p=0013) and lower compliance (01, 018 to 002) at 2 years compared with no LRTI. Recurrent LRTI was associated with further increased respiratory rate (001, 0001002), resistance (077 hPa s L(1), 007147), and lower compliance (06 mL hPa(1), 009 to 002) with each additional event. Interpretation: RSV LRTI was common in young infants and associated with recurrent LRTI, particularly after hospitalised RSV. Hospitalisation for all-cause LRTI, especially for RSV-LRTI, was associated with recurrent wheezing. Impairments in lung function followed LRTI or recurrent episodes, but were not specific to RSV. New preventive strategies for RSV might have an effect on long-term lung health.

224,"High morbidity and mortality in adults hospitalized for respiratory syncytial virus infections Background. Better understanding of complications and outcomes of adults hospitalized with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is necessary.Methods. A retrospective cohort study was conducted on all adults (18 years) admitted to 3 acute care general hospitals in Hong Kong with virologically confirmed RSV infection during 2009-2011 (N = 607). Adults hospitalized for seasonal influenza during the period were used for comparison (n = 547). Both infections were prospectively diagnosed following a standard protocol. Independent reviews of chest radiographs were performed by radiologists. Main outcome measures were all-cause death, respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support, and hospitalization duration. Cox proportional hazards models were used for analyses.Results. The mean age of RSV patients was 75 (SD, 16) years; 87% had underlying conditions. Lower respiratory and cardiovascular complications were diagnosed in 71.9% (pneumonia, 42.3%; acute bronchitis, 21.9%; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/asthma exacerbation, 27.3%) and 14.3% of patients, respectively; 12.5% had bacterial superinfections. Supplemental oxygen and ventilatory support were required in 67.9% and 11.1%, respectively. Crude all-cause mortality was 9.1% and 11.9% within 30 days and 60 days, respectively; mean length of stay of survivors was 12 (SD, 13) days. Advanced age, radiographic pneumonia, requirement for ventilation, bacterial superinfection, and elevated urea level and white blood cell count were independently associated with poorer survival. Systemic corticosteroid use was associated with longer hospitalization and secondary infections. The overall outcomes of survival and length of stay were not significantly different from those in influenza.Conclusions. RSV can cause severe lower respiratory complications in older adults, resulting in respiratory failure, prolonged hospitalization, and high mortality similar to seasonal influenza. Corticosteroids did not seem to improve outcomes. The unmet need for antiviral therapy and vaccination against RSV in adults should be promptly addressed.  2013 The Author 2013.

225,"What is respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)? Respiratory syncytial (sin-SI-shul) virus, or RSV, is a common respiratory virus that infects the lungs and breathing passages. It usually causes a mild cold-like illness (upper respiratory infection). In some people, RSV infection moves down into the lungs causing acute bronchiolitis (an inflammation of the airways) or pneumonia. Very young infants are at higher risk of having a lung infection rather than just a cold. (Sockrider M.; Katkin J.)"
226,"Immunoprophylaxis against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) with palivizumab in children: A systematic review and economic evaluation Objectives: To systematically review the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of palivizumab for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in children and examine prognostic factors to determine whether subgroups can be - identified with important differences in cost-effectiveness. Data sources: Bibliographic databases were searched from inception to March 2007 for literature on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of prophylaxis with palivizumab. Review methods: The literature was systematically reviewed and current economic evaluations were analysed to identify which parameters were driving the different cost-effectiveness estimates. A probabilistic decision-analytical model was built to assess the cost-effectiveness of prophylaxis with palivizumab for children at risk of RSV infection and the parameters populated with the best estimates thought most applicable to the UK. We also constructed a new model, the Birmingham Economic Evaluation (BrumEE). Cost-effectiveness analyses were undertaken from both NHS and societal perspectives. Results: Two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were identified. Prophylaxis with palivizumab for preterm infants without chronic lung disease (CLD) or children with CLD resulted in a 55% reduction in RSV hospital admission: 4.8% (48/1002) in the palivizumab group and 10.6% (53/500) in the no prophylaxis group (p = 0.0004). Prophylaxis with palivizumab was associated with a 45% reduction in hospitalisation nate RSV among children with coronary heart disease (CHD). Hospitalisation rates for RSV were 5.3% (34/639) in the palivizumab group and 9.7% (63/ 648) in the no prophylaxis group (p = 0.003). Of existing economic evaluations, 3 systematic reviews and 18 primary studies were identified. All the systematic reviews concluded that the potential costs of palivizumab were far in excess of any potential savings achieved by decreasing hospital admission rates, and that the use of palivizumab was unlikely to be cost-effective in all children for whom it is recommended, but that its continued use for particularly high-risk children may be justified. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of the primary studies varied 17-fold for life-years gained (LYG), from 25,800/LYG to 404,900/LYG, and several-hundred-fold for quality-adjusted life years (QALYs); from 3200/QALY to 1,489,700/QALY for preterm infants without CLD or children with CLD. For children with CHD, the ICER varied from 5300/LYG to 7900/LYG and from 7500/QALY to 68,700/QALY. An analysis of what led to the discrepant ICERs showed that the assumed mortality rate for RSV infection was the most important driver. The results of the BrumEE confirm that palivizumab does not reach conventional levels of cost-effectiveness in any of the licensed indications if used for all eligible children. Conclusions: Prophylaxis with palivizumab is clinically effective for the reducing the risk of serious lower respiratory tract infection caused by RSV infection and requiring hospitalisation in high-risk children, but if used unselectively in the licensed population, the ICER is double that considered to represent good value for money in the UK- The BrumEE shows that prophylaxis with palivizumab may be cost-effective (based on a threshold of 30,000/QALY) for children with CLD when the children have two or more additional risk factors. Future research should initially focus on reviewing systematically the major uncertainties for patient subgroups with CLD and CHD and then on primary research to address the important uncertainties that remain.

227,"Global, regional, and national disease burden estimates of acute lower respiratory infections due to respiratory syncytial virus in young children in 2015: a systematic review and modelling study Background We have previously estimated that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was associated with 22% of all episodes of (severe) acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) resulting in 55 000 to 199 000 deaths in children younger than 5 years in 2005. In the past 5 years, major research activity on RSV has yielded substantial new data from developing countries. With a considerably expanded dataset from a large international collaboration, we aimed to estimate the global incidence, hospital admission rate, and mortality from RSV-ALRI episodes in young children in 2015. Methods We estimated the incidence and hospital admission rate of RSV-associated ALRI (RSV-ALRI) in children younger than 5 years stratified by age and World Bank income regions from a systematic review of studies published between Jan 1, 1995, and Dec 31, 2016, and unpublished data from 76 high quality population-based studies. We estimated the RSV-ALRI incidence for 132 developing countries using a risk factor-based model and 2015 population estimates. We estimated the in-hospital RSV-ALRI mortality by combining in-hospital case fatality ratios with hospital admission estimates from hospital-based (published and unpublished) studies. We also estimated overall RSV-ALRI mortality by identifying studies reporting monthly data for ALRI mortality in the community and RSV activity. Findings We estimated that globally in 2015, 331 million (uncertainty range [UR] 216503) episodes of RSV-ALRI, resulted in about 32 million (2738) hospital admissions, and 59 600 (48 00074 500) in-hospital deaths in children younger than 5 years. In children younger than 6 months, 14 million (UR 1217) hospital admissions, and 27 300 (UR 20 70036 200) in-hospital deaths were due to RSV-ALRI. We also estimated that the overall RSV-ALRI mortality could be as high as 118 200 (UR 94 600149 400). Incidence and mortality varied substantially from year to year in any given population. Interpretation Globally, RSV is a common cause of childhood ALRI and a major cause of hospital admissions in young children, resulting in a substantial burden on health-care services. About 45% of hospital admissions and in-hospital deaths due to RSV-ALRI occur in children younger than 6 months. An effective maternal RSV vaccine or monoclonal antibody could have a substantial effect on disease burden in this age group. Funding The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

228,"Respiratory syncytial virus immune globulin: Decisions and costs A decision analysis was used to evaluate the economic effectiveness of respiratory syncytial virus immune globulin (RSVIG) prophylaxis on selected pediatric populations at risk for developing RSV bronchiolitis or all respiratory illness-related hospitalizations. We compared costs, outcomes, and cost-effectiveness of administering RSVIG to no treatment in different pediatric populations, including those at risk of developing RSV-bronchiolitis and those at risk of developing any respiratory illness-related hospitalization. We observed that if only infants at high risk of severe RSV infections received treatment with RSVIG, a calculated cost saving of about $27,000 per hospitalization prevented were realized. If the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved indications for RSVIG were followed, the cost to prevent one hospitalization due to RSV bronchiolitis would be over $53,000. If the aim, however, was to prevent all respiratory illness-related hospitalizations for this broader population, a much lower cost ($4,000) to prevent one hospitalization would result. In this situation, cost neutrality was possible, with a therapy cost of $2,843 compared to the actual average therapy cost of $4,444. Sensitivity analysis showed that the model was relatively insensitive to all variables, with the exceptions of costs related to RSVIG and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. We conclude that RSVIG resulted in cost savings if therapy were reserved for the infants who are at highest risk for developing severe RSV infections. RSVIG is not cost-effective for preventing RSV bronchiolitis when used according to the FDA-approved indications. Education that emphasizes frequent hand-washing, avoidance of passive smoking, and lessening exposure to sick children remains the least expensive prevention tool.  2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

229,"Healthcare costs within a year of respiratory syncytial virus among medicaid infants Limited research exists on the economic impact of respiratory syncytial virus lower respiratory infection (RSV LRI) among vulnerable infant populations. This study evaluated healthcare costs of full-term and late-preterm Medicaid infants with RSV LRI within 1 year of infection. Medicaid administrative claims were used to conduct a retrospective study of infants born 2003-2005. Full-term and late-preterm infants <1 year old were assigned to groups based on RSV LRI and unspecified bronchiolitis/pneumonia (UBP) diagnosis codes and stratified by setting of diagnosis. Infants without evidence of RSV LRI/UBP were selected as a comparison group. Economic and clinical outcomes were analyzed descriptively using propensity score weighting, and logged ordinary least squares models were used to examine relationship between RSV and costs incurred within 1 year of infection. RSV LRI and UBP infants, regardless of gestational age or healthcare setting, were more likely to experience respiratory diagnoses of wheezing and infantile asthma versus comparisons. Adjusted and weighted healthcare costs were significantly higher for all groups of RSV LRI and UBP infants relative to comparison infants (P < 0.001). Among late-preterm infants with inpatient and outpatient RSV, marginal costs compared with controls were $17,465 and $2,158, respectively. Costs for RSV LRI and UBP Medicaid infants are substantial. While much of the costs result from initial RSV episodes, higher post-episode costs and rates of respiratory events, procedures, and medications in RSV and UBP infants versus comparisons indicate long-term economic impact from infection and the impact is greater among late-preterm compared to full-term infants.  2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

230,"Prophylaxis against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), varicella, and pneumococcal infections: Economic-based decision-making Objective: To compare costs and health benefits of three prophylactic interventions recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and to help quantify the impact of illness and enhance the physicians' ability to make informed decisions. Study design: Medline search was conducted of English-language cost-effectiveness studies of varicella and pneumococcal conjugate vaccination recommended for all healthy infants and of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) prophylaxis with palivizumab (Synagis) for infants at high risk for severe RSV infection. Data were collected on cost-effectiveness, burden of illness, and efficacy and analyzed from the societal and payer perspective. Results were discounted by 5% and costs inflated to year 2002 dollars. Results: From the societal perspective, estimates of cost per life-years saved were money savings for varicella, $175,300 for pneumococcal conjugate vaccination, and $66,200 for palivizumab prophylaxis; from the payer perspective, estimates were $28,100, $338,400, and $66,400, respectively. Conclusions: Cost-effectiveness estimates for varicella and pneumococcal conjugate vaccination demonstrate that evaluating economic benefits from the societal rather than the payer perspective makes universal prophylaxis very financially attractive. By comparison, this same differential does not exist for the cost-effectiveness estimates of palivizumab from the societal and payer perspectives because its use is in a well-defined high-risk target population. From a societal perspective, prophylaxis is a rational public policy decision, although in target populations, incidence of serious illness and the primary cost components driving the cost offsets vary across prophylactic measures studied.

231,"Importance of respiratory syncytial virus as a predictor of hospital length of stay in bronchiolitis Introduction: Bronchiolitis is the leading cause of hospitalization in children. Estimate potentially preventable variables that impact the length of hospital stay are a priority to reduce the costs associated with this disease. This study aims to identify clinical variables associated with length of hospital stay of bronchiolitis in children in a tropical middle-income country Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study in 417 infants with bronchiolitis in tertiary centers in Colombia. All medical records of all patients admitted to the emergency department were reviewed. To identify factors independently associated we use negative binomial regression model, to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRR) and adjust for potential confounding variables Results: The median of the length of hospital stay was 3.68 days, with a range of 0.74 days to 29 days, 138 (33.17%) of patients have a hospital stay of 5 or more days. After modeling and controlling for potential confounders age <6 months, comorbidities (CHD or neurological), BPD, chest indrawing, RSV isolation, and C-reactive protein were independent predictors of LOS Conclusions: Our results show that in infants with bronchiolitis, RSV isolation, age <6 months, comorbidities (CHD or neurological), BPD, chest indrawing, and C-reactive protein were independent predictors of LOS. As a potentially modifiable risk factor, efforts to reduce the probability of RSV infection can reduce the high medical cost associates with prolonged LOS in bronchiolitis. (Buendia J.A.)

232,"Global respiratory syncytial virus-associated mortality in young children (RSV GOLD): a retrospective case series Background Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is an important cause of pneumonia mortality in young children. However, clinical data for fatal RSV infection are scarce. We aimed to identify clinical and socioeconomic characteristics of children aged younger than 5 years with RSV-related mortality using individual patient data. Methods In this retrospective case series, we developed an online questionnaire to obtain individual patient data for clinical and socioeconomic characteristics of children aged younger than 5 years who died with community-acquired RSV infection between Jan 1, 1995, and Oct 31, 2015, through leading research groups for child pneumonia identified through a comprehensive literature search and existing research networks. For the literature search, we searched PubMed for articles published up to Feb 3, 2015, using the key terms RSV respiratory syncytial virus or respiratory syncytial viral combined with mortality fatality death died deaths or CFR for articles published in English. We invited researchers and clinicians identified to participate between Nov 1, 2014, and Oct 31, 2015. We calculated descriptive statistics for all variables. Findings We studied 358 children with RSV-related in-hospital death from 23 countries across the world, with data contributed from 31 research groups. 117 (33%) children were from low-income or lower middle-income countries, 77 (22%) were from upper middle-income countries, and 164 (46%) were from high-income countries. 190 (53%) were male. Data for comorbidities were missing for some children in low-income and middle-income countries. Available data showed that comorbidities were present in at least 33 (28%) children from low-income or lower middle-income countries, 36 (47%) from upper middle-income countries, and 114 (70%) from high-income countries. Median age for RSV-related deaths was 50 months (IQR 23110) in low-income or lower middle-income countries, 40 months (20100) in upper middle-income countries, and 70 months (36168) in high-income countries. Interpretation This study is the first large case series of children who died with community-acquired RSV infection. A substantial proportion of children with RSV-related death had comorbidities. Our results show that perinatal immunisation strategies for children aged younger than 6 months could have a substantial impact on RSV-related child mortality in low-income and middle-income countries.

233,"Modeling household dynamics on Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is the most common cause of respiratory tract infection in infants and children and shows increasing trend among elderly people worldwide. In many developing country settings, population and household structures have gone through some significant changes in the past decades, namely fewer births, more elderly population, and smaller household size but more RSV high-risk individuals. These dynamics have been captured in a mathematical model with RSV transmission dynamics to predict the disease burden on the detailed population for future targeted interventions. The population and disease dynamics model was constructed and tested against the hospitalization data for Acute Lower Respiratory Tract Infection due to RSV in rural Thai settings between 2005 and 2011. The proportion of extended families is predicted to increase by about 10% from 2005 to 2020, especially for those with elderly population, while the classic nuclear family type (with adults and children) will decline by about 10%. For RSV, infections from extended family type (approximately 60% of all household types) have majorly contributed to the force of infection (FOI). While the model predicted the increase of FOI from the extended family by 15% from 2005 to 2020, the FOI contributed by other household types would be either stable or decrease in the same time period. RSV incidence rate is predominantly high among babies (92.2%) and has been predicted to decrease slightly over time (from 940 to 864 cases per 100,000 population by 2020), while the incidence rates among children and elderly people may remain steadily low over the same period. However, the estimated incidence rates among elderly people were twice than those in children. The model predicts that approximately 60% of FOI for RSV will come from members of the extended family type. The incidence rate of RSV among children and elderly in extended families was about 20 times lower than that in infants and the trend is steady. Targeted intervention strategies, such as health education in some specific groups and targeted vaccination, may be considered, with the focus on extended family type. Target interventions on babies can lessen the transmission to children and elderly especially when transmission within households of extended family type is high.

237,"Respiratory syncytial virus- and human metapneumovirus-associated emergency department and hospital burden in adults Objective: Determine the burden of illness associated with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) in adults, especially young adults. Design: Prospective surveillance study using RT-PCR for the diagnosis of RSV and HMPV. Setting: One academic Emergency Department (ED), one academic hospital and three middle Tennessee community hospitals. Sample: We prospectively enrolled Middle Tennessee residents 18 years old evaluated in the emergency department (ED) or hospitalized for respiratory symptoms May 2009 through April 2010. We collected nose/throat specimens for RSV and HMPV reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing and obtained demographic and clinical data. Main outcome Measures: Rates of ED visits and hospitalizations were calculated using the proportion of enrolled patients positive for each virus multiplied by the number of Middle Tennessee residents evaluated in EDs and/or hospitalized in Tennessee for acute respiratory illness during the study period. Results: Three thousand two hundred and fifty six patients were eligible; 1477 (454%) were enrolled; 1248 (845%) of these consented to additional testing and had adequate samples. RT-PCR identified 32 (26%) patients with RSV and 33 (26%) with HMPV. The median duration of symptoms before ED presentation was 33 days with RSV and 28 days with HMPV, and before hospital admission was 45 days with RSV and 35 days with HMPV. The annual hospitalization and ED visit rates were similar for RSV and HMPV. The hospitalization rate associated with each virus was about 10 per 10 000 persons aged 50 years; ED rates were approximately 2 times higher. Hospitalization rates were about 2 per 10 000 persons aged 18-49 years, with ED rates 5-6 times higher. Conclusion: RSV and MPV are associated with substantial disease in adults, with hospitalization and ED visits rates increasing with age.  2014 The Authors.

238,"Community-acquired pneumonia in immunocompromised older patients: Incidence, causative organisms and outcome The number of elderly patients in the community with immunosuppressive conditions has increased progressively over recent decades. We sought to determine the incidence, causative organisms and outcome of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) occurring in immunocompromised older patients. We prospectively compared cases of CAP in immunocompromised and non-immunocompromised patients admitted to five public hospitals in three Spanish regions. Of 320 cases studied, 115 (36%) occurred in immunocompromised patients, including: solid or hematological malignancy (97), corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive drugs (44), solid organ or stem cell transplant (five), and other conditions (eight). The etiology was established in 44% of immunocompromised patients vs. 32% of non-immunocompromised patients (p0.03). Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common causative organism in both groups (29% vs. 21%; p0.08), followed by Legionella pneumophila (3% vs. 6%; p0.01). Gram-negative bacilli were more frequent among immunocompromised patients (5% vs. 0.5%; p<0.01), particularly Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3% vs. 0%; p0.04). Nocardiosis was only observed in immunocompromised patients (two cases). Bacteremia occurred similarly in the two groups. No significant differences were found with respect to ICU admission (8%, in both groups) or the length of stay (12.5 vs. 10.4days). The early (<48h) (3.5 vs. 0.5%; p0.04) and overall case-fatality rates (12% vs. 3%; p<0.01) were higher in immunocompromised patients. In conclusion, a substantial number of older patients hospitalized for CAP are immunocompromised. Although relatively uncommon, CAP due to gram-negative bacilli, including P. aeruginosa, is more frequent among these patients. CAP occurring in immunocompromised patients causes significant morbidity and mortality.  2012 The Authors.

239,"Ribavirin treatment of respiratory syncytial virus infection in neonatal intensive care unit survivors Objective: To determine the value of aerosolised ribavirin in the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis. Design: a retrospective study. Setting: The paediatric intensive care units of two tertiary care centres. Subjects: Forty one former premature (<36 weeks) infants requiring mechanical ventilation (MV) for documented RSV infection (by either Elisa and/ or culture). Intervention: Twenty-one patients received 16 h of aerosolised ribavirin for 3 days (group A) and 20 infants did not receive any ribavirin (group B). Measurements: The groups were compared for age, sex, weight, gestational age, incidence of apnoea, blood gas analysis, alveolar-arterial gradients, PaO(2), PaCO(2), and underlying pulmonary disease. Outcome variables included paediatric risk of mortality (PRISM) score, days of mechanical ventilation (MV), ICU days, hospital length of stay, and mortality. The data were analysed using the student t-test, chisquare and logistic regression. Results: There was no difference between the two study groups in age, sex, birth weight, gestational age, underlying pulmonary disease, incidence of apnoea, or blood gas analysis. There was no difference in PRISM score (6.1 vs. 6.5, p = 0.60), days of MV (5.3 vs. 6.9, p = 0.37), ICU length of stay (7.1 vs 7.7, p = 0.71) and hospital length of stay (10.3 vs. 12.3, p = 0.30). There were no deaths in group A and two deaths in group B (Fisher Exact Test, p = 0.23) suggesting no significant relationship between the use of ribavirin and death. Conclusion: The delivery of aerosolised ribavirin appears to represent little value in decreasing hospital morbidity and/ or mortality in high-risk infants. (Sanchez J.L.; Conway E.E.; Rubin D.H.)

240,"Mathematical modelling of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in low- and middle-income countries: A systematic review Background: Due to high burden of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), international funding organizations have prioritized the development of RSV vaccines. Mathematical models of RSV will play an important role in assessing the relative value of these interventions. Our objectives were to provide an overview of the existing RSV modelling literature in LMIC and summarize available results on population-level effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. Methods: We searched MEDLINE from 2000 to 2020 for English language publications that employed a mathematical model of RSV calibrated to LMIC. Qualitative data were extracted on study and model characteristics. Quantitative data were collected on key model input assumptions and base case effectiveness and cost-effectiveness estimates for various immunization strategies. Findings: Of the 283 articles reviewed, 15 met inclusion criteria. Ten studies used modelling techniques to explore RSV transmission and/or natural history, while eight studies evaluated RSV vaccines and/or monoclonal antibodies, three of which included cost-effectiveness analyses. Six studies employed deterministic compartmental models, five studies employed individual transmission models, and four studies used different types of cohort models. Nearly every model was calibrated to at least one middle-income country, while four were calibrated to low-income countries. Interpretation: The mathematical modelling literature in LMIC has demonstrated the potential effectiveness of RSV vaccines and monoclonal antibodies. This review has demonstrated the importance of accounting for seasonality, social contact rates, immunity from prior infection and maternal antibody transfer. Future models should consider incorporating individual-level risk factors, subtype-specific effects, long-term sequelae of RSV infections, and out-of-hospital mortality.

241,"Epidemiology of respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis in hospitalized infants in Greece New therapies have been introduced for the prophylaxis and treatment of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in recent years. The aim of the study was to determine the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis in our area. All patients under 1 year of age admitted with acute bronchiolitis during four consecutive RSV seasons from February 1, 1997 to June 30, 2000 were enrolled in the study. The records of patients admitted during the first season were reviewed retrospectively while the rest were followed prospectively. A total of 636 infants with bronchiolitis were admitted and RSV infection was documented in 61% of those tested. Admission to intensive care unit (ICU) was required for 6.2% of them and was more common in premature infants (26%) (p < 0.001). Case fatality rate was 0.7% (overall 0.3%). RSV bronchiolitis accounted for about 12% of all infant admissions during the 5 months of the yearly outbreak. Patients with documented RSV infection had a more severe illness with a higher ICU admission rate (6 vs. 1%, p = 0.008) and longer duration of hospitalization (mean 6.3 vs. 5.3 days, p < 0.001) compared to those who tested negative. Although none of the patients had a positive blood culture on admission a considerable number of them (210/636, 33%) were treated with antibiotics. RSV infection has a significant impact on infant morbidity in our settings which is more serious among those born prematurely. Documentation of RSV infection may be a marker of more severe illness in infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis. Antibiotic use has to be restricted since the occurrence of a serious bacteraemic illness on admission is a very rare event.

242,"Pediatric RSV-Associated Hospitalizations before and during the COVID-19 Pandemic Importance: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of pediatric hospitalizations. Objective: To describe the epidemiology and burden of RSV-associated hospitalizations among children and adolescents in Canadian tertiary pediatric hospitals from 2017 to 2022, including changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study was conducted during 5 RSV seasons (2017-2018 to 2021-2022) at 13 pediatric tertiary care centers from the Canadian Immunization Monitoring Program Active (IMPACT) program. Hospitalized children and adolescents aged 0 to 16 years with laboratory-confirmed RSV infection were included. Main Outcomes and Measures: The proportion of all-cause admissions associated with RSV and counts and proportions of RSV hospitalizations with intensive care unit (ICU) admission, prolonged stay (7 days), and in-hospital mortality were calculated overall and by season, age group, and region. Seasonality was described using epidemic curves. RSV hospitalizations for 2021-2022 were compared with those in the prepandemic period of 2017-2018 through 2019-2020. Bonferroni corrections were applied to P values to adjust for multiple statistical comparisons. Results: Among 11014 RSV-associated hospitalizations in children and adolescents (6035 hospitalizations among male patients [54.8%]; 5488 hospitalizations among patients aged <6 months [49.8%]), 2594 hospitalizations (23.6%) had admission to the ICU, of which 1576 hospitalizations (60.8%) were among children aged less than 6 months. The median (IQR) hospital stay was 4 (2-6) days. The mean (SD) number of RSV-associated hospitalizations during prepandemic seasons was 2522 (88.8) hospitalizations. There were 58 hospitalizations reported in 2020-2021, followed by 3170 hospitalizations in 2021-2022. The proportion of all-cause hospitalizations associated with RSV increased from a mean of 3.2% (95% CI, 3.1%-3.3%) before the pandemic to 4.5% (95% CI, 4.3%-4.6%) in 2021-2022 (difference, 1.3 percentage points; 95% CI, 1.1-1.5 percentage points; corrected P <.001). A significant increase in RSV-associated hospitalizations was found in 2021-2022 for 3 provinces (difference range, 2.5 percentage points; 95% CI, 1.4-3.6 percentage points for Quebec to 2.9 percentage points; 95% CI, 1.4-3.5 percentage points for Alberta; all corrected P <.001). Age, sex, ICU admission, prolonged length of stay, and case fatality rate did not change in 2021-2022 compared with the prepandemic period. Interregional differences in RSV seasonality were accentuated in 2021-2022, with peaks for 1 province in October, 4 provinces in December, and 3 provinces in April, or May. Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that the burden of RSV-associated hospitalizations in Canadian pediatric hospitals was substantial, particularly among infants aged less than 6 months, and RSV hospitalizations increased in 2021-2022 compared with the prepandemic period, while severity of illness remained similar. These findings suggest that RSV preventive strategies for infants aged less than 6 months would be associated with decreased RSV disease burden in children.. (Bourdeau M.; Moore D.)

243,"New strategies for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is the main cause of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in newborns in the first two years of life. RSV disease has a traditional seasonal trend, with an onset and offset, duration and peak. Prematurity, male gender, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), critical congenital cardiovascular disorders (CCHD), neuromuscular diseases, congenital and inherited airways anatomical anomalies are the main risk factors for increased severity of this infection. RSV infection is associated with negative long-term respiratory outcomes, with excess of morbidity, resulting in reduced quality of life of the infected children and representing a burden for the healthcare costs and resources. Despite all the efforts, prevention remains, to date, the most effective strategy to reduce RSV-related morbidity. Among the current prevention strategies, strict hygiene, breastfeeding and passive immunization with the monoclonal antibody Palivizumab are the cornerstone. In the next future, it is likely that new possibilities of prevention will add, including use of more potent and longer-acting monoclonal antibodies, implementation of maternal vaccination in pregnancy, and active immunization in children. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the main current and future prevention strategies against RSV.

244,"Prevention and Treatment Strategies for Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of severe lower respiratory tract disease, especially in young children. Despite its global impact on healthcare, related to its high prevalence and its association with significant morbidity, the current therapy is still mostly supportive. Moreover, while more than 50 years have passed since the first trial of an RSV vaccine (which unfortunately caused enhanced RSV disease), no vaccine has been approved for RSV prevention. In the last two decades, our understanding of the pathogenesis and immunopathology of RSV have continued to evolve, leading to significant advancements in RSV prevention strategies. These include both the development of new potential vaccines and the successful implementation of passive immunization, which, together, will provide coverage from infancy to old age. In this review, we provide an update of the current treatment options for acute disease (RSV-specific and -non-specific) and different therapeutic approaches focusing on RSV prevention.

245,"High frequency oscillatory ventilation in severe RSV infection High frequency oscillatory (HFOV) has been progressively useful in children with severe hypoxemic and hypercapnic respiratory insufficiency, at Pediatric Intensive Care Units. Objectives: To describe our experience in treatment of children with severe RSV infection unresponsive to conventional ventilation (CV), to describe effectiveness in gas exchange and to evaluate the safety of the method. A descriptive and prospective study set at two paediatric intensive care units, in Hospital Roberto del Rio and Clinica Santa Maria of Santiago, Chile between January 2001 and December 2004. Results: 36 patients between 0.5 and 10 months of age with severe RSV infection and respiratory failure unresponsive to mechanical ventilation were connected to HFOV after an average time of conventional ventilation of 2.6 days. Arterial pH improved during the first hour in HFOV from 7.18 to > 7.3. Initial PaO (2)/FiO(2) in average was 104.8, there was a slow and progressive improvement until 72 hours (138). FiO(2) diminished since an average of 74% till 63.6% at 72 hours pCO(2) went down from an average of 88 mm de Hg pre HFOV to 50 mmHg at 12 hours, remaining low. Oxygenation index, preHFOV, was in average 18 and it maintained in 17 at 72 hours, with a FiO(2) < 60%. Patients were hold in HFOV between 2-18 days. 3/36 patients died after 1.5, 4 and 18 days of HFOV. 8,3% presented air leak. One of these patients is oxygen dependent after 12 months of following. Conclusions: High frequency oscillatory ventilation is a useful method in the management of acute respiratory failure in children with severe infection for RSV unresponsive to conventional ventilation. It can improve gas exchange slowly and progressively with a low risk of air leak, secuelae and death. (Yanez P L., lyanez@csm.cl; Lapadula A M.)

246,"Bacteremia in Adults Admitted from the Emergency Department with Laboratory-Confirmed Respiratory Syncytial Virus Background: Collecting blood cultures from patients admitted from the emergency department (ED) with acute respiratory infection (ARI) is common, but the rate of secondary bacteremia in adult patients admitted from the ED with ARI associated with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is unknown. Indiscriminate collection of blood cultures can be associated with contaminated blood cultures and increased inappropriate antimicrobial use and health care costs. Objective: This study sought to determine the rate and etiology of secondary bacteremia, factors associated with secondary bacteremia, and factors associated with collecting blood cultures in the ED, in adults hospitalized with RSV. Methods: We performed a retrospective substudy using data from a prospective study of adults admitted with RSV infections during two respiratory seasons (October 2017 to April 2018 and October 2018 to April 2019). Blood cultures were collected at the discretion of ED providers. We compared demographic and clinical characteristics among those with and without secondary bacteremia and among those with and without blood cultures collected using multivariate logistic regression models. Results: Of the 365 hospitalized RSV-positive patients (mean age 68.8 years), 269 (73.7%) had blood cultures collected in the ED and 18 (6.7%) patients had secondary bacteremia, most commonly from a nonrespiratory source (n = 13). Patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were significantly less likely to have secondary bacteremia. Patients who were immunocompromised, met systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria, or had pneumonia described on chest x-ray reports were more likely to have blood cultures collected. Conclusions: Overall, 6.7% of adults hospitalized with RSV infections had secondary bacteremia, more commonly from nonrespiratory sources. (Sano E.; Chang B.)

247,"Morbidity and outcome of severe respiratory syncytial virus infection Background Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the main cause of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) in infants and young children. This study aimed to identify risk factors for intensive care unit (ICU) admission, prolonged length of stay (PLOS), and mortality in patients hospitalized with SARI caused by RSV. Methods This prospective cohort study included children hospitalized with SARI (according to the World Health Organization definition) and whose laboratory results proved RSV infection during the period from February 2010 to May 2011. Results Out of 240 enrolled patients, 24 patients (10%) were admitted to the ICU, 57 patients (24.3%) had a PLOS of >9 days and 12 patients (5%) died. The presence of cyanosis (P = 0.000; OR, 351.7) and lung consolidation (P = 0.006, OR, 9.3) were independent risk factors associated with ICU admission. The need for ICU admission (P = 0.000; OR, 6.1) and lung consolidation (P = 0.008, OR, 2.46) were independent risk factors associated with PLOS. The presence of an underlying congenital heart disease (P = 0.03, OR, 18.3), thrombocytopenia (P = 0.04, OR, 32.86) and mechanical ventilation (P = 0.000; OR, 449.4) were the only independent risk factors associated with mortality in our study.

248,"Respiratory Syncytial Virus: Knowledge, Attitudes and Beliefs of General Practitioners from North-Eastern Italy (2021) Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a lead cause of morbidity and hospitalizations in infants. RSV vaccines are currently under development, and preventive options are limited to monoclonal antibodies (mAb). We assessed the knowledge, attitudes and practices for RSV in a sample of general practitioners (GPs) from north-eastern Italy (2021), focusing on the risk perception for infants (age < 8 years) and its potential effectors. We administered an internet survey to 543 GPs, with a response rate of 28.9%. Knowledge status was unsatisfactory, with substantial knowledge gaps found on the epidemiology of RSV and its prevention through mAb. The main effectors of risk perception were identified as having a background in pediatrics (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 55.398 and 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 6.796451.604), being favorable towards RSV vaccines when available (aOR: 4.728, 95% CI: 1.99911.187), while having previously managed an RSV case (aOR: 0.114, 95% CI: 0.0240.552) and previously recommended hospitalization for cases (aOR: 0.240, 95% CI: 0.0660.869) were identified as negative effectors. In summary, the significant extent of knowledge gaps and the erratic risk perception, associated with the increasing occurrence in RSV infections, collectively stress the importance of appropriate information campaigns among primary care providers.

249,"Long-term consequences of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis. Despite differences in study design, follow-up studies consistently show that approximately half of the infants with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) go on to have recurrent wheezing episodes during childhood. Respiratory symptoms are associated with abnormal lung function, including bronchial hyper-responsiveness. Wheezing symptoms following RSV LRTI gradually decrease, and it appears that during school age airway morbidity is no longer related to RSV LRTI during infancy. Mechanisms underlying the association between RSV LRTI and long-term airway morbidity are poorly understood. On the one hand, abnormal airway function that is congenitally present or acquired before RSV LRTI occurs could be the cause of both RSV LRTI and subsequent recurrent wheezing. On the other hand, it is possible that RSV LRTI causes changes in the lower airways or the immune system that result in long-term airway morbidity. Animal models suggest that RSV infection can promote the development of allergic sensitization, but most studies in humans do not indicate a role for atopy in the development of recurrent wheezing following RSV LRTI.

Here we report Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) genomic RNA can be detected in wastewater settled solids at two publicly owned treatment works (POTWs). We further show that its concentration in settled solids is strongly associated with clinical positivity rates for RSV at sentinel laboratories across the state in 2021, a year with anomalous seasonal trends in RSV disease. Given that RSV infections have similar clinical presentations to COVID-19, can be life threatening for some, and immunoprophylaxis distribution for vulnerable people is based on outbreak identification, WBE represents an important tool to augment current RSV surveillance and public health response efforts.

251,"Respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis: Cost-effective analysis in Argentina Introduction. Respiratory syncytial virus is a major cause of bronchiolitis during the first year of life. Preterm infants and patients with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) have a higher risk of hospitalization. The objective of this study was to assess the risk of hospitalization and to evaluate the cost effectiveness of palivizumab use in our at risk population. Methods. The study design was based on the hypothetical use of palivizumab in a cohort of patients. The cost effectiveness analysis included costs of palivizumab, the drug prescription and hospitalization. The effectiveness measure was the hospitalization rate decrease according to the result of the IMpact study: a 55% reduction in the need for hospitalization attributable to RSV. The years 1998 and 1999 were analyzed. Evaluable patients had follow-up at the High Risk Clinic and fulfilled the American Academy of Pediatrics criteria for palivizumab prophylaxis. Results. Forty-two patients, 24 with BPD and 18 preterm infants without BPD, were evaluated. Ten patients required hospitalization because of respiratory syncytial virus; one of them died. Hospitalization cost was $184 777. The total palivizumab administration cost would have been $185 064. With a 55% decrease of hospitalization rate, the cost per hospitalization averted would have been $15 358, and the number needed to treat would have been 7.9. A sensitivity analysis showed that the cost per hospitalization averted could range between $2171 and $48 630 according to the hospitalization rate. Conclusions. Because new effective but expensive treatments like palivizumab are available, this cost effective analysis can be an important tool in decisions about resource distribution.

252,"Morbidity and mortality of respiratory syncytial virus infection in hospitalized adults: Comparison with seasonal influenza Introduction: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is considered a major pathogen that causes acute influenza-like illness. The objective of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of patients with laboratory-confirmed RSV and patients with influenza infection. Methods: Adults hospitalized in Beilinson Hospital (October 2017April 2018) with laboratory-confirmed RSV or influenza were included. The primary outcome was the composite of RSV/influenza complications: 30-day mortality, pneumonia, mechanical ventilation, vasopressor support, intensive care unit admission, and myocarditis/encephalitis. Secondary outcomes were individual components of the primary outcome, 90-day mortality, 90-day readmission, and length of hospital stay. Results: A total of 639 patients with RSV (n = 113) and influenza (n = 526) were included. The composite primary outcome was 21.4% (136/633), and was higher in RSV patients (30% (34/113) vs 19% (102/526), p = 0.002). Pneumonia was more common in RSV patients (21.2% (24/113) vs 9.1% (48/526), p = 0.001). On multivariable analysis, hypoalbuminemia (odds ratio (OR) 3.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.15.3, p < 0.001), reduced room-air saturation (OR 1.1, 95% CI 1.021.1, p = 0.001), and infection with RSV (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.012.76, p = 0.046) were predictors of complications.

Costs of ED visits were approximately $202 million. RSV bronchiolitis was the leading cause of infant hospitalization annually. Total hospital charges for RSV-coded primary diagnoses during the 4 years were more than $2.6 billion. An estimated 390 RSV-associated postneonatal deaths occurred in 1999. Low birth weight and prematurity significantly increased RSV-associated mortality rates. Conclusions: RSV is a major cause of infant morbidity and mortality. Severe RSV is highest among infants of black mothers and Medicaid-insured infants. Prematurity and low birth weight significantly increase RSV mortality rates.

255,"Severe morbidity and mortality associated with respiratory syncytial virus versus influenza infection in hospitalized older adults Background. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an important cause of serious respiratory illness in older adults. Comparison of RSV and influenza infection in hospitalized older adults may increase awareness of adult RSV disease burden. Methods. Hospitalized adults aged 60 years who tested positive for RSV or influenza between 1 January 2011 and 30 June 2015 were identified from Kaiser Permanente Southern California electronic medical records. Baseline characteristics, comorbidities, utilization, and outcomes were compared. Results. The study included 645 RSV-and 1878 influenza-infected hospitalized adults. Patients with RSV were older than those with influenza (mean, 78.5 vs 77.4 years; P =.035) and more likely to have congestive heart failure (35.3% vs 24.5%; P <.001) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (29.8% vs 24.3%; P =.006) at baseline. In adjusted analyses, RSV infection was associated with greater odds of length of stay =7 days (odds ratio [OR] = 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-1.8; P <.001); pneumonia (OR = 2.7; 95% CI, 2.2-3.2; P <.001); intensive care unit admission (OR = 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0-1.7; P =.023); exacerbation of COPD (OR = 1.7; 95% CI, 1.3-2.4; P =.001); and greater mortality within 1 year of admission (OR = 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0-1.6; P =.019). Conclusions. RSV infection may result in greater morbidity and mortality among older hospitalized adults than influenza. Increased recognition of adult RSV disease burden will be important in the evaluation and use of new RSV vaccines and antivirals.

256,"Multiple Respiratory Syncytial Virus Introductions into a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Background: Outbreaks of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) are of concern because of the risk of severe disease in young infants. We describe an outbreak of RSV in a NICU and use whole genome sequencing (WGS) to better understand the relatedness of viruses among patients. Methods: An investigation was conducted to identify patients and describe their clinical course. Infection control measures were implemented to prevent further spread. Respiratory specimens from outbreak-related patients and the community were tested using WGS. Phylogenetic trees were constructed to understand relatedness of the viruses. Results: Seven patients developed respiratory symptoms within an 11-day span in December 2017 and were diagnosed with RSV; 6 patients (86%) were preterm and 1 had chronic lung disease. Three patients required additional respiratory support after symptom onset, and none died. Six of 7 patients were part of the same cluster based on > 99.99% nucleotide agreement with each other and 3 unique single-nucleotide polymorphisms were identified in viruses sequenced from those patients. The seventh patient was admitted from the community with respiratory symptoms and had a genetically distinct virus that was not related to the other 6. Implementation of enhanced infection control measures likely limited the spread. Conclusions: Using WGS, we found 2 distinct introductions of RSV into a NICU, highlighting the risk of healthcare-associated infections during RSV season. Early recognition and infection control measures likely limited spread, emphasizing the importance of considering RSV in the differential diagnosis of respiratory infections in healthcare settings.

258,"Burden of respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis on the Dutch pediatric intensive care units Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis causes substantial morbidity and mortality in young children, but insight into the burden of RSV bronchiolitis on pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) is limited. We aimed to determine the burden of RSV bronchiolitis on the PICUs in the Netherlands. Therefore, we identified all children  24 months of age with RSV bronchiolitis between 2003 and 2016 from a nationwide PICU registry. Subsequently we manually checked their patient records for correct diagnosis and collected patient characteristics, additional clinical data, respiratory support modes, and outcome. In total, 2161 children were admitted to the PICU for RSV bronchiolitis. The annual number of admissions increased significantly during the study period ( 4.05, SE 1.27, p = 0.01), and this increase was mostly driven by increased admissions in children up to 3 months old. Concomitantly, non-invasive respiratory support significantly increased ( 7.71, SE 0.92, p < 0.01), in particular the use of high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) ( 6.69, SE 0.96, p < 0.01), whereas the use of invasive ventilation remained stable. Conclusion: The burden of severe RSV bronchiolitis on PICUs has increased in the Netherlands. Concomitantly, the use of non-invasive respiratory support, especially HFNC, has increased.What is Known: RSV bronchiolitis is a major cause of childhood morbidity and mortality and may require pediatric intensive care unit admission. The field of pediatric critical care for severe bronchiolitis has changed due to increased non-invasive respiratory support options.What is New: The burden of RSV bronchiolitis for the Dutch PICUs has increased. These data inform future strategic PICU resource planning and implementation of RSV preventive strategies. There was a significant increase in the use of high flow nasal cannula at the PICU, but the use of invasive mechanical ventilation did not decrease.

Because of maternally acquired antibodies, symptomatic RSV infection is rare in term neonates. During an outbreak of RSV in our neonatal ICU, 12 infants (gestational age = 34  5 weeks) remained RSV negative. In contrast, eight preterm infants (gestational age = 28  2 weeks) became RSV positive. Four infants became very sick with RSV and required mechanical ventilation and support. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) developed in two of them resulting in death of one of them. Control measures were effective in controlling the outbreak.

260,"Respiratory syncytial virus outbreak in a tertiary hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Introduction Investigation and control of a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) outbreak that affected the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of a university hospital from October to December 2012. Patients and methods Cohort study of children admitted to the NICU. The infection attack rate was calculated. A descriptive analysis of the cases and a multivariate analysis was performed using the variables that were shown to be risk factors for RSV infection. Preventive measures taken were: contact isolation; hand hygiene training and observation; exclusivity of a health team of nurses and physicians for positive cases, restrictions on visitor numbers; surveillance RSV testing, and palivizumab prophylaxis. Results The outbreak had three epidemic waves and 20 positive cases out of a total of 48 children admitted. The overall attack rate was 42%. Half of positive cases were children, with a median age of 36 days (p25 = 22, p75 = 58). The independent risk factors for RSV infection were birth weight below 1000 grams (OR = 23.5; P=.002) and to have another nosocomial infection the week before the diagnosis of RSV infection (OR = 19.98; P=.016). Conclusions It was an outbreak with a high number of cases, due to the delay in notification, prolonged RSV carrier status, and low adherence to hand hygiene practice, which favoured the cross-transmission of infection. The most effective preventive measures were direct observation of hand hygiene and supervision of isolation measures.

261,"Influenza- and respiratory syncytial virus-associated morbidity and mortality in the nursing home population OBJECTIVES: To estimate winter viral-related morbidity and mortality in Tennessee nursing home residents during 4 consecutive years. DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Three hundred eighty-one Tennessee nursing homes. PARTICIPANTS: Nursing home residents. MEASUREMENTS: Viral surveillance data were used to define three seasons: influenza (influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) cocirculating), RSV (RSV alone circulating), and non winter-viral (neither virus circulating). Adjusted seasonal differences in rates of cardiopulmonary hospitalizations, antibiotic prescriptions, and deaths during these three seasons were calculated to estimate annual hospitalizations, courses of antibiotics, and deaths attributable to influenza and RSV from 1995 to 1999. RESULTS: Nursing home residents had 81,885 person-years of follow-up. In the 63% of residents with comorbid conditions that increase influenza morbidity, influenza infection contributed to an estimated average of 28 hospitalizations, 147 courses of antibiotics, and 15 deaths per 1,000 persons annually. Similarly, RSV accounted for an annual average of 15 hospitalizations, 76 courses of antibiotics, and 17 deaths per 1,000 persons. Influenza and RSV accounted for 7% of cardiopulmonary hospitalizations and 9% of total deaths in high-risk residents during the 4 study years. Absolute morbidity and mortality were lower in residents without identified comorbid conditions but accounted for 15% of hospitalizations and 14% of deaths. These estimates depend on the assumption that morbidity and mortality from other respiratory viruses were distributed evenly between the three defined seasons. CONCLUSION: Influenza and RSV substantially increased hospitalization rates, antibiotic use, and deaths in elderly nursing home residents each winter. These data should encourage persistent efforts toward disease prevention, and thoughtful study of vaccine development and delivery, diagnostic tools, and methods of prophylaxis and therapy.

However, substantial progress has been made in recent years in the field of RSV. A wide variety of observational studies and clinical trials published in the past decade provide a thorough idea of the health and economic burden of RSV disease in the developing world. In this review, we discuss the impact of RSV burden of disease, major gaps in disease estimations, and challenges in generating new therapeutic options and an immune response against the virus, and briefly describe next generation technologies that are being evaluated.

264,"Hospitalizations due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections in Germany: a nationwide clinical and direct cost data analysis (20102019) Purpose: Clinical and direct medical cost data on RSV-related hospitalizations are relevant for public health decision-making. We analyzed nationwide data on RSV-coded hospitalizations from Germany in different age and risk groups. Methods: Assessment of RSV-coded hospitalizations (ICD-10-GM RSV code J12.1/J20.5/J21.0 as primary discharge diagnosis) from 01/2010 to 12/2019, using remote data retrieval from the Hospital Statistics Database of the German Federal Statistical Office. Results: Overall, 130,084 RSV-coded hospitalizations (123,091 children < 18 years, 1260 adults, 5733 seniors > 59 years) were reported (median age < 1 year, IQR 0; 1; 56% males, 50% with RSV pneumonia). Annual median RSV-coded hospitalization incidence was 15.7/100,000 persons (IQR 13.5; 17.8); children reported a median incidence of 90.9 (IQR 82.5; 101.9). Between 2010 and 2019, hospitalization incidence increased 1.5-fold/4.5-fold/111-fold in children/adults/seniors. Adults and seniors reported higher rates of underlying chronic conditions, complications, and intensive care treatment than children; of 599 in-hospital fatalities, 92/51/456 occurred in children/adults/seniors. Per-patient mean costs varied between 3443  4924 in 14 year-olds and 7339  13,650 among adults. Increased costs were associated with immune disorders (2.45-fold increase compared to those without), nervous system disorders (2.56-fold), sepsis (6.88-fold), ARDS (11.92-fold), intensive care (4.85-fold), and ECMO treatment (16.08-fold). Conclusion: The economic burden of RSV-related hospitalizations in Germany is substantial, even when only considering cases with RSV coded as the primary discharge diagnosis. Children represented the vast majority of RSV coded hospitalizations. However, adults and seniors hospitalized for RSV were at a higher risk of severe complications, required more costly treatments, and had higher fatality rates; although their RSV-coded hospitalization incidence showed a clear upward trend since 2017, their true hospitalization incidence is still likely to be underestimated due to lack of routine RSV testing in these age groups. Hence, new treatments and vaccines for RSV ideally should also target adults and seniors in addition to children.

266,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in children with medical complexity Children with medical complexity (CMC) are vulnerable to respiratory illness hospitalization (RIH) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-related hospitalization (RSVH) due to multisystem disorders and compromised airways. It is unknown whether RSV prophylaxis is effective, or if RSVH is associated with significant morbidities in CMC. The study objectives were to (1) determine the incidence of RSV-related infection in prophylaxed CMC during the first 3 years of life and (2) assess the burden of illness following RSVH. A single tertiary center, retrospective study, was conducted of CMC who received palivizumab during the 20122016 RSV seasons. Fifty-four subjects were enrolled; most received one (38.9%, n = 21) or two (57.4%, n = 31) seasons of prophylaxis (mean = 4.2 [SD = 1.24], palivizumab doses per season). The cohort comprised children with multiple medical conditions (n = 22, 40.8%), tracheostomy (n = 18, 33.3%), and invasive (n = 10, 18.5%) or non-invasive (n = 4, 7.4%) ventilation. Of the CMC, 24 were hospitalized 47 times for a viral-related respiratory illness. RSV incidence in the first 3 years of life was 7.4%. Viral-related RIH and RSVH rates were 44.4% (n = 24/54) and 1.9% (n = 1/54), respectively. Of the four RSV-positive children, one was ventilated for 9 days, two acquired nosocomial RSV that was managed on the ward, and one was discharged home under close complex care supervision. All four RSV-positive cases required additional oxygen during their illness. CMC experience a high viral-related RIH rate and palivizumab likely minimizes RSV-related events and associated morbidities. The efficacy of palivizumab in CMC, especially in those  3 years, should be prospectively evaluated.

Significant morbidity and mortality was observed among hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients (7.3%, 60-day mortality), solid organ transplant patients (13.3%, 60-day mortality), and COPD patients (12.8%, 60-day mortality). Of the patients positive for RSV, 144 (43.1%) of 334 received antibacterials or antifungals following diagnosis. Of these patients, a bacterial or fungal pathogen was not recovered from 60% of cases.

268,"Palivizumab for preventing severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in children Background: Respiratory viruses are the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) and hospitalisation in infants and young children. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the main infectious agent in this population. Palivizumab is administered intramuscularly every month during five months in the first RSV season to prevent serious RSV LRTI in children. Given its high cost, it is essential to know if palivizumab continues to be effective in preventing severe RSV disease in children. Objectives: To assess the effects of palivizumab for preventing severe RSV infection in children. Search methods: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, three other databases and two trials registers to 14 October 2021, together with reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. We searched Embase to October 2020, as we did not have access to this database for 2021. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cluster-RCTs, comparing palivizumab given at a dose of 15 mg/kg once a month (maximum five doses) with placebo, no intervention or standard care in children 0 to 24 months of age from both genders, regardless of RSV infection history. Data collection and analysis: We used Cochranes Screen4Me workflow to help assess the search results. Two review authors screened studies for selection, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We used standard Cochrane methods. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. The primary outcomes were hospitalisation due to RSV infection, all-cause mortality and adverse events. Secondary outcomes were hospitalisation due to respiratory-related illness, length of hospital stay, RSV infection, number of wheezing days, days of supplemental oxygen, intensive care unit length of stay and mechanical ventilation days. Main results: We included five studies with a total of 3343 participants. All studies were parallel RCTs, assessing the effects of 15 mg/kg of palivizumab every month up to five months compared to placebo or no intervention in an outpatient setting, although one study also included hospitalised infants. Most of the included studies were conducted in children with a high risk of RSV infection due to comorbidities like bronchopulmonary dysplasia and congenital heart disease. The risk of bias of outcomes across all studies was similar and predominately low. Palivizumab reduces hospitalisation due to RSV infection at two years' follow-up (risk ratio (RR) 0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30 to 0.64; 5 studies, 3343 participants; high certainty evidence). Based on 98 hospitalisations per 1000 participants in the placebo group, this corresponds to 43 (29 to 62) per 1000 participants in the palivizumab group. Palivizumab probably results in little to no difference in mortality at two years' follow-up (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.15; 5 studies, 3343 participants; moderate certainty evidence). Based on 23 deaths per 1000 participants in the placebo group, this corresponds to 16 (10 to 27) per 1000 participants in the palivizumab group. Palivizumab probably results in little to no difference in adverse events at 150 days' follow-up (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.39; 3 studies, 2831 participants; moderate certainty evidence). Based on 84 cases per 1000 participants in the placebo group, this corresponds to 91 (71 to 117) per 1000 participants in the palivizumab group. Palivizumab probably results in a slight reduction in hospitalisation due to respiratory-related illness at two years' follow-up (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.97; 5 studies, 3343 participants; moderate certainty evidence). Palivizumab may result in a large reduction in RSV infection at two years' follow-up (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.55; 3 studies, 554 participants; low certainty evidence). Based on 195 cases of RSV infection per 1000 participants in the placebo group, this corresponds to 64 (39 to 107) per 1000 participants in the palivizumab group. Palivizumab also reduces the number of wheezing days at one year's follow-up (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.44; 1 study, 429 participants; high certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions: The available evidence suggests that prophylaxis with palivizumab reduces hospitalisation due to RSV infection and results in little to no difference in mortality or adverse events. Moreover, palivizumab results in a slight reduction in hospitalisation due to respiratory-related illness and may result in a large reduction in RSV infections. Palivizumab also reduces the number of wheezing days. These results may be applicable to children with a high risk of RSV infection due to comorbidities. Further research is needed to establish the effect of palivizumab on children with other comorbidities known as risk factors for severe RSV disease (e.g. immune deficiencies) and other social determinants of the disease, including children living in low- and middle-income countries, tropical regions, children lacking breastfeeding, living in poverty, or members of families in overcrowded situations.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: SARS-CoV-2 is known to cause milder disease in children when compared with adults, but the extent of this is unclear. The aim of this article is to estimate the case fatality rate (CFR) for SARS-CoV-2 infection and SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in young children aged <5 years, and compare this with estimated CFRs for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza. METHOD: This article reviews published case series of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the paediatric population and epidemiological data on COVID-19 published on official government websites internationally and in Australia. RESULTS: The CFR of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in children aged <5 years is estimated to be 0.15-1.35%, which is lower than the estimated CFR of RSV pneumonia of 0.3-2.1%, but higher than the estimated CFR of influenza pneumonia of 0.14-0.45%. DISCUSSION: SARS-CoV-2 infection is likely to be less lethal than RSV in children aged <5 years, but more lethal than influenza. (Wei J.S.)

270,"Pediatric intensive care unit admission due to respiratory syncytial virus: Retrospective multicenter study Background: We investigated the characteristics and clinical outcomes of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-related pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) hospitalization and assessed the palivizumab (PZ) prophylaxis eligibility according to different guidelines from Korea, EU, and USA. Methods: In this multicenter study, children <18 years of age hospitalized in six PICU from different hospitals due to severe RSV infection between September 2008 and March 2013 were included. A retrospective chart review was performed. Results: A total of 92 patients were identified. The median length of PICU stay was 6 days (range, 1154 days) and median PICU care cost was USD2,741 (range, USD55698 243). Of 62 patients who were <2 years old at the beginning of the RSV season, 33 (53.2%) were high-risk patients for severe RSV infection. Hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease (22.6%) was the most common risk factor, followed by chronic lung disease (11.3%), neuromuscular disease or congenital abnormality of the airway (NMD/CAA) (11.3%), and prematurity (8.1%). The percentage of patients eligible for PZ prophylaxis ranged from 38.7% to 48.4% based on the guidelines, but only two (2.2%) received PZ 30 days prior to PICU admission. The median duration of mechanical ventilation was longer in children with NDM/CAA than in those without risk factors (26 days; range, 24139 days vs 6 days, range, 268 days, P = 0.033). RSV-attributable mortality was 5.4%. Conclusions: Children <2 years old with already well-known high risks represent a significant proportion of RSV-related PICU admissions. Increasing of the compliance for PZ prophylaxis practice among physicians is needed. Further studies are needed to investigate the burden of RSV infection in patients hospitalized in PICU, including children with NMD/CAA.

271,"RSV pneumonia in the pediatric intensive care unit Objective: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common and fatal cause of bronchiolitis and severe pneumonia, especially in infants. Its morbidity and mortality are unpredictably high in critically ill patients. The aim of our study is to identify high-risk patients for early diagnosis and treatment of RSV pneumonia in the pediatric intensive care unit and to reduce hospitalizations and mortality. We want to emphasize the importance of vaccination and followup for the protection of other viral or bacterial pneumonia once again. Material and Methods: We present 12 cases that were diagnosed as RSV pneumonia in our tertiary pediatric intensive care unit. Besides history, physical examination, and chest radiograph findings, patients were diagnosed with laboratory tests, such as complete blood count, c-reactive protein (CRP), and virus isolation with nasal smear samples. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were obtained from patients' medical files. Results: Within 5 months of the study, 12 patients were diagnosed with RSV pneumonia. Risk factors were present in 11. Two of the patients were 35 weeks premature; others were born full-term, and none of them had received palivizumab prophylaxis. Except for a patient with a history of episodes of bronchiolitis, all of the patients had one or more risk factors for pneumonia. Nine of the patients (75%) were male, while 3 were female. Median age was 18.5 months (min: 2; max: 53 months). Five of our patients required mechanical ventilation. Two patients could not be separated from the ventilator; so, tracheostomy was performed and patients were discharged with home ventilation. One of the patients included in the study died. Conclusion: We want to emphasize that RSV, seen especially in infants, is also an important factor in older children; it might be fatal, and pediatric intensive care admission might be necessary. Therefore, before determining medical therapy, underlying risk factors should be remembered.  2014 by Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society. (Ayar G., ganimeayar@gmail.com; Sahin S.; Yazici M.U.)

273,"Burden and Cost of Hospitalization for Respiratory Syncytial Virus in Young Children, Singapore Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of pediatric acute lower respiratory tract infection worldwide. Detailed data on the health and economic burden of RSV disease are lacking from tropical settings with year-round RSV transmission. We developed a statistical and economic model to estimate the annual incidence and healthcare cost of medically attended RSV disease among young children in Singapore, using Monte Carlo simulation to account for uncertainty in model param-eters. RSV accounted for 708 hospitalizations in children <6 months of age (33.5/1,000 child-years) and 1,096 in children 6-29 months of age (13.2/1,000 child-years). The cost of hospitalization was SGD 5.7 million (US $4.3 million) at 2014 prices; patients bore 60% of the cost. RSV-associated disease burden in tropical settings in Asia is high and comparable to other settings. Further work incorporating efficacy data from ongoing vaccine trials will help to determine the potential cost-effectiveness of different vaccination strategies.

Methods: Retrospective data on demographics, clinical presentation, outcomes and laboratory findings of 450 children admitted into Tuanku Jaafar Hospital in Seremban, Malaysia from 2008 to 2013 with documented diagnosis of RSV ALRI were collected and analysed. Results: Most admissions were children below 2 years old (85.8%; 386/450). Commonest symptoms were fever (84.2%; 379/450), cough (97.8%; 440/450) and rhinorrhea (83.6%; 376/450). The median age among febrile patients (n = 379) was 9.0 months with interquartile range (IQR) of 4.0-19.0 months whereas the median age among those who were apyrexial (n = 71) was 2 months with IQR of 1-6 months (P-value <0.001). 15.3% (69/450) needed intensive care and 1.6% (7/450) died. Young age, history of prematurity, chronic comorbidity and thrombocytosis were significantly associated with prolonged hospital stay, PICU admission and mortality. Conclusions: Infants less than 6 months old with RSV ALRI tend to be afebrile at presentation. Younger age, history of prematurity, chronic comorbidity and thrombocytosis are predictors of severe RSV ALRI among Malaysian children. Case fatality rate for Malaysian children below 5 years of age with RSV ALRI in our centre is higher than what is seen in developed countries, suggesting that there is room for improvement.

276,"The natural history of respiratory syncytial virus infection in cancer and transplant patients: Implications for management Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has been reported to cause severe morbidity and mortality among cancer patients receiving chemotherapy with or without autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (APBSCT). However, little is known about the natural history of this infection in these patients, and current standard practice, aerosolized ribavirin plus intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), is extremely expensive, difficult to use, and not supported by controlled clinical trials. The purpose of this observational study was to determine the frequency, seasonality, morbidity, and mortality of RSV infection in a group of cancer patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy with neither ribavirin nor IVIG treatment. During the period of October 3, 1997, through October 14, 1998, 190 cancer patients (median age, 58 years; 71 women) underwent viral nasopharyngeal washing prior to chemotherapy. Multiple myeloma (MM) accounted for most patients (147, 77%). RSV was recovered from cultures taken from 71 patients (37%) throughout the year, although more frequently during fall and winter seasons (P < .001) than spring and summer. Serious respiratory complications developed in 19 (27%) of 71 RSV-positive patients versus 24 (20%) of 119 patients whose RSV cultures were negative (P = .384). The presence of renal failure or increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) prior to chemotherapy and the development of mucositis were the only predictive factors for severe respiratory complications. Recovery of RSV from nasopharyngeal washings among cancer patients is common, occurs throughout the year, and does not appear to increase serious morbidity or mortality. RSV infection may not necessarily be a contraindication for APBSCT or an indication for therapy with aerosolized ribavirin and IVIG.  2004 by The American Society of Hematology.

277,"Evaluation of the live-attenuated intranasal respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine RSV/6120/NS2/1030s in RSV-seronegative young children BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of pediatric lower respiratory illness (LRI) and a vaccine for immunization of children is needed. RSV/6120/NS2/1030s is a cDNA-derived live-vaccine candidate attenuated by deletion of the interferon antagonist NS2 gene and the genetically-stabilized ""1030s"" missense polymerase mutation in the polymerase, conferring temperature sensitivity. METHODS: A single intranasal dose of RSV/6120/NS2/1030s was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (vaccine/placebo ratio, 2:1) at 105.7 plaque-forming units (PFU) in 15 RSV-seropositive 12-to-59-month-old children, and at 105 PFU in 30 RSV-seronegative 6-to-24-month-old children. RESULTS: RSV/6120/NS2/1030s infected 100% of RSV-seronegative vaccinees and was immunogenic (geometric mean RSV plaque-reduction neutralizing antibody titer [RSV-PRNT], 1:91) and genetically stable. Mild rhinorrhea was detected more frequently in vaccinees (18/20 V vs 4/10 P, p=0.007), and LRI occurred in 1 vaccinee during a period when only vaccine virus was detected. Following the RSV season, 5/16 vaccinees had 4-fold rises in RSV-PRNT with significantly higher titers than 4/10 placebo recipients with rises (1:1992 vs. 1:274, P=0.02). Thus, RSV/6120/NS2/1030s primed for substantial anamnestic neutralizing antibody responses following naturally-acquired RSV infection. CONCLUSION: RSV/6120/NS2/1030s is immunogenic and genetically stable in RSV-seronegative children, but the frequency of rhinorrhea in vaccinees exceeded that in placebo recipients.A live-attenuated intranasal respiratory syncytial virus vaccine candidate containing a deletion of the interferon antagonist NS2 gene and a genetically stabilized temperature-sensitivity mutation in the polymerase gene was infectious and induced primary neutralizing serum antibody responses and potent memory antibody responses in 6-to-24 month-old RSV-seronegative children, but may be associated with rhinorrhea.

278,"Announcement: World Pneumonia Day - November 12, 2016 November 12th marks the eighth annual World Pneumonia Day, observed to raise awareness of pneumonia as a global public health concern for persons of all ages and a leading infectious cause of death of children aged <5 years, causing approximately 900,000 child deaths annually (1). In the United States, the majority of the 53,000 annual pneumonia deaths occur in persons aged 65 years. Respiratory viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza, and Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria are among the leading causes of pneumonia; RSV annually causes an average of 177,000 hospitalizations and 14,000 deaths in adults aged 65 years in the United States (1,2). In addition, approximately 5,000 cases of Legionnaires' disease occur each year in the United States, a 286% increase from 2000-2014; the case fatality rate is about 10% (1).

279,"Respiratory syncytial virus hospitalization outcomes and costs of full-term and preterm infants Objective: Infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which causes lower respiratory tract infections, is the leading cause of hospitalization among children <1 year old in the United States. Risk factors for RSV hospitalization include premature birth and younger chronologic age, along with several comorbid conditions. However, in terms of RSV hospitalization costs, premature infants are rarely studied separately from full-term infants. The objective of this study is to describe the cost and severity of RSV hospitalizations among preterm and full-term infants without chronic lung disease or other high-risk conditions. Study design: This analysis used Truven Health Market Scan Multi-State Medicaid and Commercial Claims and Encounters databases, which contain a combined 4 million births from 2003 to 2013. Infants with comorbid conditions associated with increased risk for RSV infection were excluded. Infants were classified as preterm (<29, 29-30, 31-32, 33-34 and 35-36 weeks' gestational age (wGA)) or full term based on diagnostic coding. Health-care claims during the first year of life were evaluated for RSV hospitalizations, defined as inpatient claims with a diagnosis code for RSV in any position. Costs of RSV hospitalizations were captured and reported in 2014 USD. Inpatient claims for RSV hospitalizations were evaluated for the presence of codes indicating admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), use of mechanical ventilation (MV) and length of stay. These three measures were used to describe hospital severity. Chronologic age at the time of RSV hospitalization was also captured. Data were summarized and no statistical comparisons were conducted. Results: There were 1 683 188 infants insured through Medicaid and 1 663 832 infants insured through commercial plans born from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2013. Of those, 10.8 and 8.8% in each database, respectively, were born prematurely. There were 29 967 Medicaid-insured infants and 16 310 commercially insured infants with an RSV hospitalization during their first year of life. Mean first-year RSV hospitalization costs were higher for preterm infants, ranging from $8324 and $10 570 for full-term infants to $15 839 and $19 931 for preterm infants 33-34 wGA, and to $39 354 and $40 813 for preterm infants <29 wGA, among Medicaid-insured and commercially insured infants, respectively. RSV hospitalizations also tended to be more severe among preterm infants, with longer lengths of stay, a higher proportion of infants admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and increased use of MV compared with full-term infants. Mean costs of RSV hospitalizations with a PICU admission ranged from approximately $35 000 to $89 000. In both Medicaid and commercial groups, costs were greater for infants hospitalized at <90 days of age compared with older infants. Conclusions: Infants who were born prematurely and those hospitalized at <90 days of age have more costly and more severe RSV hospitalizations during the first year of life. These findings demonstrate important differences in the costs and severity of first-year RSV hospitalizations of premature and full-term infants. These differences are likely to be obscured in combined analysis, in which full-term infants predominate. Clinical guidelines and health-care policies relating to RSV would benefit from the availability of data obtained from separate analyses of these two infant subgroups.

280,"Acute lower respiratory infections associated with respiratory syncytial virus in children with underlying congenital heart disease: Systematic review and meta-analysis Background. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common viral pathogen associated with acute lower respiratory infections (ALRIs), with significant childhood morbidity and mortality worldwide. Estimates reporting RSV-associated ALRI (RSVALRI) severity in children with congenital heart disease (CHD) are lacking, thus warranting the need to summarize the available data. We identified relevant studies to summarize the findings and conducted a meta-analysis of available data on RSV-associated ALRI hospitalizations in children aged <5 years, comparing those with underlying CHD to those without CHD. Methods. We conducted a systematic search of existing relevant literature and identified studies reporting hospitalization of children aged <5 years with RSV-ALRI with underlying or no CHD. We summarized the data and conducted (where possible) a random-effects meta-analysis to compare the 2 groups. Results. We included 18 studies that met our strict eligibility criteria. The risk of severe RSV-ALRI (odds ratio, 2.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6-2.8), the rate of hospitalization (incidence rate ratio, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.9-4.1), and the case-fatality ratio (risk ratio [RR], 16.5; 95% CI, 13.7-19.8) associated with RSV-ALRI was higher among children with underlying CHD as compared to those without no CHD. The risk of admission to the intensive care unit (RR, 3.9; 95% CI, 3.4-4.5), need for supplemental oxygen therapy (RR, 3.4; 95% CI, .5-21.1), and need for mechanical ventilation (RR, 4.1; 95% CI, 2.1-8.0) was also higher among children with underlying CHD. Conclusion. This is the most detailed review to show more-severe RSV-ALRI among children aged <5 years with underlying CHD, especially hemodynamically significant underlying CHD, as compared those without CHD, supporting a need for improved RSV prophylactics and treatments that also have efficacy in children older than 1 year.

281,"Disease Burden Estimates of Respiratory Syncytial Virus related Acute Respiratory Infections in Adults With Comorbidity: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Background. Respiratory syncytial virus related acute respiratory infection (RSV-ARI) constitutes a substantial disease burden in adults with comorbidities. We aimed to identify all studies investigating the disease burden of RSV-ARI in this group. Methods. We estimated the incidence, hospitalization rate, and in-hospital case fatality ratio (hCFR) of RSV-ARI in adults with comorbidities based on a systematic review of studies published between January 1996 and March 2020. We also investigated the association between RSV-ARI and any comorbidity in adults. Meta-analyses based on random effects model were carried out. Results. Overall, 20 studies were included. The annual incidence rate of RSV-ARI in adults with any comorbidity was 37.6 (95% confidence interval [CI], 20.170.3) per 1000 persons per year in industrialized countries and the seasonal incidence rate was 28.4 (11.470.9) per 1000 persons per season. The hCFR in industrialized countries was 11.7% (5.8%23.4%). There were no studies in developing countries. There were insufficient data to generate the meta-estimate of hospitalization rate. The likelihood of experiencing RSV-ARI for those with any comorbidity compared to those without was estimated to be 4.1 (odds ratio [OR], 1.610.4) and 1.1 (OR, 0.61.8) from studies using univariable and multivariable analysis respectively. Conclusion. The disease burden of RSV-ARI among adults with comorbidity is substantial with limited data available.

282,"Exploring the dynamics of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) transmission in children Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the main cause of lower respiratory tract infections in children. Whilst highly seasonal, RSV dynamics can have either one-year (annual) or two-year (biennial) cycles. Furthermore, some countries show a 'delayed biennial' pattern, where the epidemic peak in low incidence years is delayed. We develop a compartmental model for RSV infection, driven by a seasonal forcing function, and conduct parameter space and bifurcation analyses to document parameter ranges that give rise to these different seasonal patterns. The model is sensitive to the birth rate, transmission rate, and seasonality parameters, and can replicate RSV dynamics observed in different countries. The seasonality parameter must exceed a threshold for the model to produce biennial cycles. Intermediate values of the birth rate produce the greatest delay in these biennial cycles, while the model reverts to annual cycles if the duration of immunity is too short. Finally, the existence of period doubling and period halving bifurcations suggests robust model dynamics, in agreement with the known regularity of RSV outbreaks. These findings help explain observed RSV data, such as regular biennial dynamics in Western Australia, and delayed biennial dynamics in Finland. From a public health perspective, our findings provide insight into the drivers of RSV transmission, and a foundation for exploring RSV interventions.

283,"Right ventricular function in children with severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis Background. Previous studies have demonstrated the development of myocardial damage and hepatitis in children with severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. The aim of this study was to assess right ventricular function in children with severe RSV disease and to investigate an association with disease severity, myocardial damage, and hepatitis. Methods. This was a prospective observational study performed at a 20-bed regional multidisciplinary tertiary pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) in a university-affiliated children's hospital. Pulse wave Doppler echocardiographic assessments with a calculation of the right ventricular function (Tei index), left ventricular ejection fraction and diameters, cardiac troponin T levels, transaminase and C-reactive protein levels were performed at admission on consecutive children who were ventilated and diagnosed with a severe RSV infection and without congenital heart disease. Results. Thirty-four ventilated children with confirmed RSV bronchiolitis were enrolled. The median age was 1.4 months (range 0.4-11.7), and the median length of ventilation was 5 days (range 2-10). Seven (20%) infants had an elevated right ventricular Tei index indicating reduced right ventricular function. Left ventricular function as well as C-reactive protein and transaminase levels were not different between patients with and without an elevated right ventricular Tei index. Cardiac troponin T was elevated in 14 patients (41%): 3/7 with an elevated and 11/27 with a normal Tei index (P=1). Ventilation and oxygenation indices and the duration of mechanical ventilation were not different between the two groups. Conclusion. A raised right ventricular Tei index, consistent with reduced right ventricular function, was observed in severe RSV disease, but the degree of dysfunction was not related to the level of biochemical myocardial or hepatic damage or level of respiratory support.

Respiratory support included humidified high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (76% of patients since its introduction in 2011), non-invasive ventilation (41%) and intubation and mechanical ventilation (32%). Almost half (n = 270; 45%) had one or more pre-existing comorbid condition. Risk factors for intubation and mechanical ventilation were presence of comorbidities (odds ratio 1.97; confidence interval 1.392.79, P < 0.001) and transfer from an external hospital (odds ratio 1.82; confidence interval 1.582.57, P < 0.001). Of the children without pre-existing comorbidities, 25% required intubation and mechanical ventilation. Following the introduction of humidified high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy, the number of annual PICU admissions for RSV infection doubled; however, the number of children requiring intubation remained unchanged. The median length of intensive care unit stay was 3.7 days and further hospital stay was 3.6 days, and the average cost per case was approximately AU$20000. Conclusions: RSV infection carries a high burden in PICU, in bed-days and cost. Chronic comorbidities and transfer from a peripheral hospital were associated with a higher rate of need for mechanical ventilation.

285,"Medical and economic impact of a respiratory syncytial virus outbreak in a neonatal intensive care unit Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes frequent nosocomial outbreaks in general pediatric wards but is less commonly reported in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). We investigated an outbreak of RSV infection in a NICU and its impact on health care delivery, outcomes and costs. Methods: Retrospective chart review was performed after an RSV outbreak occurred in the NICU. A case was defined as an infant with a nasopharyngeal aspirate positive for RSV by viral culture. Nucleotide sequencing of the isolates was done to determine relatedness. Hospital bills for all RSV culture-positive infants were reviewed. Results: Nine infants (mean age, 34 days; mean birth weight, 1757 g; and mean estimated gestational age 31 weeks and 5 days) were infected with RSV subgroup B during this outbreak. By nucleotide sequencing, the isolates were identical. Clinical manifestations included cough, congestion, increased oxygen requirement, apnea and respiratory failure. The 5 infants requiring intubation had a significantly lower mean birth weight (1301 g versus 2328 g, P = 0.027), mean estimated gestational age (28 weeks and 5 days versus 35 weeks and 2 days, P = 0.014) and mean weight at onset of symptoms (2093 g versus 2989 g, P = 0.049) than the 4 nonintubated infants. More than 1.15 million dollars in hospital charges were attributable to the outbreak. All infants survived. Conclusion: Infants in a NICU who develop cough, congestion or apnea should be tested for RSV and other common respiratory viruses during the winter respiratory season. Even in a closed NICU, nosocomial outbreaks of these viruses can occur and have a major effect on healthcare delivery, costs and outcomes. Copyright  2005 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

287,"Respiratory syncytial virus-associated acute lower respiratory infections in children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia: Systematic review and meta-analysis Background. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is among the most important causes of acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRI) in young children. We assessed the severity of RSV-ALRI in children less than 5 years old with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Methods. We searched for studies using EMBASE, Global Health, and MEDLINE. We assessed hospitalization risk, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, need for oxygen supplementation and mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital case fatality (hCFR) among children with BPD compared with those without (non-BPD). We compared the (1) length of hospital stay (LOS) and (2) duration of oxygen supplementation and mechanical ventilation between the groups. Results. Twenty-nine studies fulfilled our inclusion criteria. The case definition for BPD varied substantially in the included studies. Risks were higher among children with BPD compared with non-BPD: RSV hospitalization (odds ratio [OR], 2.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7-4.2; P < .001), ICU admission (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 2.3-3.5; P < .001), need for oxygen supplementation (OR, 4.2; 95% CI, .5-33.7; P = .175) and mechanical ventilation (OR, 8.2; 95% CI, 7.6-8.9; P < .001), and hCFR (OR, 12.8; 95% CI, 9.4-17.3; P < .001). Median LOS (range) was 7.2 days (4-23) (BPD) compared with 2.5 days (1-30) (non-BPD). Median duration of oxygen supplementation (range) was 5.5 days (0-21) (BPD) compared with 2.0 days (0-26) (non-BPD). The duration of mechanical ventilation was more often longer (>6 days) in those with BPD compared with non-BPD (OR, 11.9; 95% CI, 1.4-100; P = .02). Conclusions. The risk of severe RSV disease is considerably higher among children with BPD. There is an urgent need to establish standardized BPD case definitions, review the RSV prophylaxis guidelines, and encourage more specific studies on RSV infection in BPD patients, including vaccine development and RSV-specific treatment.

However, there are no vaccines and adequate drugs for its treatment. We showed, for the first time, that O-linked coumarin-monoterpene conjugates are effective RSV inhibitors. The most potent compounds are active against both RSV serotypes, A and B. According to the results of the time-of-addition experiment, the conjugates act at the early stages of virus cycle.

289,"Paramyxovirus infection: Mortality and morbidity in a pediatric intensive care unit Objectives: We investigated mortality and morbidity of patients admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with paramyxovirus infection.Methods: A retrospective study between October 2002 and March 2015 of children with a laboratory-confirmed paramyxovirus infection was included.Results: In all, 98 (5%) PICU admissions were tested positive to have paramyxovirus infection (respiratory syncytial virus = 66, parainfluenza = 27 and metapneumovirus = 5). The majority of admissions were young patients (median age 1.05 years). Bacteremia and bacterial isolation in any site were present in 10% and 28%, respectively; 41% were mechanically ventilated, and 20% received inotropes. The three respiratory viruses caused similar mortality and morbidity in the PICU. Fatality (seven patients) was associated with malignancy, positive bacterial culture in blood, the use of mechanical ventilation, inotrope use, lower blood white cell count and higher C reactive protein (p = 0.02-0.0005). Backward binary logistic regression for these variables showed bacteremia (odds ratio [OR]: 31.7; 95% CI: 2.3-427.8; p = 0.009), malignancy (OR: 45.5; 95% CI: 1.4-1467.7; p = 0.031) and use of inotropes (OR: 15.0; 95% CI: 1.1-196.1; p = 0.039) were independently associated with non-survival.

290,"Respiratory syncytial virus: clinical and epidemiological pattern in pediatric patients admitted to a children's hospital between 2000 and 2013 INTRODUCTION: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the major causative organism associated with acute lower respiratory tract infections in children.The objective of this study was to describe the clinical and epidemiological pattern of RSV and identify risk factors for RSV infection.POPULATION AND METHODS: Prospective, cohort study on patients hospitalized due to acute lower respiratory tract infection at Hospital de Ninos Ricardo Gutierrez between March and November throughout the 2000-2013 period. The virological diagnosis of RSV, adenovirus, influenza and parainfluenza was performed by indirect immunofluorescence using nasopharyngeal aspirates.RESULTS: A total of 12,555 children were included, 38.2% (4798) had virus rescued from samples. RSV accounted for 81.8% of cases (3924/4798) with no significant annual variations (71.2- 88.1) and with an epidemic seasonal pattern(May through July); RSV was followed by influenza (7.6%), parainfluenza (5.9%), and adenovirus (4.7%).The median age of patients with RSV rescue (3924) was 7 months old (0- 214 months old), while 74.2% were younger than 1 year old, 43.1% were younger than 6 months old, 56.5% were males and the most common clinical presentation was bronchiolitis (60.7%). Comorbidities were observed in 41.6% of cases. The most common comorbidities were chronic respiratory disease (74%), congenital heart disease (14%), and chronic neurological disease (10.2%).Complications occurred in 25%of cases. The case fatality rate was 1.9% (74/3888). Independent predictors of RSV infection were age <3 months old (OR: 2.8 [2.14-3.67], p < 0.01),clinical presentation of bronchiolitis (OR: 1.54 [1.32-1.79], p < 0.01), and hypoxemia at the time of admission (OR: 1.84 [1.42-2.37], p < 0.01).CONCLUSIONS: RSV infection displayed a seasonal pattern and was associated with infants younger than 3 months old with bronchiolitis and hypoxemia at the time of admission.

291,"High frequency oscillatory ventilation for respiratory failure due to RSV bronchiolitis Objective: To describe the time course of high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis. Design: Retrospective charts review. Setting: A tertiary paediatric intensive care unit. Patients and participants: Infants with respiratory failure due to RSV infection. Intervention: HFOV. Measurements and results: Pattern of lung disease, ventilatory settings, blood gases, infant's vital parameters, sedation and analgesia during the periods of conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV, 6 infants), after initiation of HFOV (HFOVi, 9 infants), in the middle of its course (HFOVm), at the end (HFOVe) and after extubation (Post-Extub) were compared. All infants showed a predominant overexpanded lung pattern. Mean airway pressure was raised from a mean (SD) 12.5 (2.0) during CMV to 18.9 (2.7) cmH(2)O during HFOVi (P < 0.05), then decreased to 11.1(1.3) at HFOVe (P < 0.05). Mean FiO(2) was reduced from 0.68 (0.18) (CMV) to 0.59 (0.14) (HFOVi) then to 0.29 (0.06) (P < 0.05) at HFOVe and mean peak to peak pressure from 44.9 (12.4) cmH(2)O (HFOVi) to 21.1 (7.7) P < 0.05 (HFOVe) while mean (SD) PaCO(2) showed a trend to decrease from 72 (22) (CMV) to 47 (8) mmHg (HFVOe) and mean infants respiratory rate a trend to increase from 20 (11) (HFOVi) to 34 (14) (HFOVe) breaths/min. With usual doses of sedatives and opiates, no infant was paralysed and all were extubated to CPAP or supplemental oxygen after a mean of 120 h.

292,"High frequency oscillatory ventilation and conventional mechanical ventilation in the treatment of infants with severe respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia: A randomized controlled trial Objective To compare the clinical efficacy of high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) and conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV) in the treatment of infants with severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) pneumonia. Methods A prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted. The infants with severe RSV pneumonia who received invasive mechanical ventilation admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) of Children's Hospital Affiliated to Capital Institute of Pediatrics from January 2018 to December 2019 were enrolled. According to the order of admission, each infant was assigned to HFOV group or CMV group by random number table. The basic data, pediatric critical score, blood gas analysis, ventilator parameters, oxygenation index [OI, OI = mean airway pressure (Pmean)fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2)/arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2)100], duration of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU stay, complications, prognosis, use of muscle relaxants and vasoactive drugs and other clinical indicators of the two groups were recorded. Results A total of 28 infants were enrolled in the analysis, including 15 infants receiving CMV and 13 infants receiving HFOV. There were no significant differences in age, body weight, pediatric critical score and OI before enrollment, type II respiratory failure, multiple organ dysfunction, basic diseases and laboratory examination indexes before enrollment between the two groups. Six hours after enrollment, compared with CMV group, heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), case of transcutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO2) decrease, case of HR decrease, case of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and OI in HFOV group were significantly decreased [HR (bpm): 130 (125, 138) vs. 144 (140, 160), RR (times/min): 35 (34, 38) vs. 40 (35, 45), SpO2 decrease (case: 1 vs. 10), HR decrease (case: 0 vs. 6), CPR (case: 0 vs. 4), OI: 6.5 (4.4, 8.9) vs. 9.3 (8.0, 12.8)], while case of use of muscle relaxants (case: 3 vs. 0) and volume of 7-day positive fluid balance [mL/kg: 167.1 (113.8, 212.6) vs. 90.8 (57.8, 112.7)] were significantly higher, the differences were statistically significant (all P < 0.05). There was no use of blood purification treatment, no severe complications such as pneumothorax and intracranial hemorrhage, and no death within 28 days in the two groups. Conclusion Compared with CMV, HFOV in the treatment of infants with severe RSV pneumonia can improve the oxygenation level and clinical physiological indexes earlier, reduce the incidence of adverse events such as HR, SpO2 decrease and CPR, increase the use of muscle relaxants and the positive fluid balance, and do not increase the incidence of severe complications such as pneumothorax and intracranial hemorrhage, so its clinical application is safe.

293,"Changing costs and the impact on RSV prophylaxis Objective: Acquisition costs of palivizumab have increased in Canada since 2007. This analysis aims to re-evaluate the cost effectiveness of palivizumab in Canada for premature infants born between 32 and 35 weeks' gestational age using updated 2010 healthcare costs compared to those used in a 2007 decision analytic model. Methods: New costs (CAN$) were acquired from the same Health Canada and Ontario Ministry of Health sources that were utilized in the previously published 2007 model. Palivizumab prices were acquired from Abbott Laboratories Ltd., current as of August 2010. Results: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) rose by $742, going from $30,618/QALY to $31,360/QALY. ICER changes increased from a range of $801,297 to $820,701 for infants with zero risk factors to a decrease from $808 to $192 for infants with four or more risk factors. Conclusions: Palivizumab ICERs remained fairly stable from 2007 to 2010. The original recommendation stating that palivizumab is cost effective in infants born between 32 and 35 weeks' GA with two or more risk factors, or who are at moderate-to-high risk based on a risk assessment model, does not change. Analyses founded on evolving country-specific variables are needed in order to accurately reassess the cost effectiveness of interventions as costs change worldwide. Limitations: There are a limited number of publications reporting mortality in premature Canadian infants with RSV as a primary outcome.

We describe the clinical epidemiology and outcomes among a large cohort of older adults hospitalized with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in the United States. Methods. Hospitalized adults aged 60 years who tested positive for RSV between 1 January 2011 and 30 June 2015 were identified from Kaiser Permanente Southern California. Patient-level demographics, comorbidities, clinical presentation, utilization, complications, and mortality were evaluated. Results. There were 664 patients hospitalized with RSV (61% female, 64% aged 75 years). Baseline chronic diseases were prevalent (all >30%); 66% developed pneumonia, 80% of which were radiographically confirmed. Very severe tachypnea (26 breaths/ minute) was common (56%); 21% required ventilator support and 18% were admitted to intensive care unit. Mortality during hospitalization was 5.6% overall (4.6% in 60-74 year olds and 6.1% in 75 year olds). Cumulative mortality within 1, 3, 6, and 12 months of admission was 8.6%, 12.3%, 17.2%, and 25.8%, respectively. Conclusion. RSV infection in hospitalized older adults often manifested as severe, life-threatening lower respiratory tract illness with high rates of pneumonia, requirement for ventilatory support, and short- and long-term mortality.

296,"Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)-Specific Antibodies in Pregnant Women and Subsequent Risk of RSV Hospitalization in Young Infants Background: The fusion (F) glycoprotein of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) represents the major neutralizing antigen, and antibodies against the pre-F conformation have the most potent neutralizing activity. This study aimed to assess the correlation between maternal antibody titers against the pre-F, post-F, and G glycoproteins and the child's risk of developing severe RSV bronchiolitis early in infancy. Methods: We identified previously healthy term infants <3 months of age hospitalized with RSV bronchiolitis from December 2015 to March 2016. We measured IgG antibody titers to pre-F, post-F, and G proteins in maternal sera obtained at 9-12 weeks of pregnancy of these hospitalized infants' mothers (n=94) and compared them with serum antibody titers of control pregnant mothers (n=130) whose children were not hospitalized. Results: All maternal samples (n=224) had detectable pre-F antibodies. Pre-F antibody titers were significantly lower in mothers whose infants were hospitalized with RSV bronchiolitis compared with those mothers whose infants were not hospitalized (23.9 [range (or antibody titer range), 1.4-273.7] g/L vs 30.6 [XXX, 3.4-220.0] g/L; P=0026). There were no significant differences in maternal post-F and G antibody titers between hospitalized and nonhospitalized infants.

A number of different assay formats are currently in use worldwide so there is a need for an accurate and high-throughput method for measuring RSV NAbs. We describe here an imaging-based micro-neutralization assay that has been tested on RSV subgroup A and can also be adapted for RSV subgroup B and different sample types. This method is highly reproducible, with inter-assay variations for the reference antiserum being less than 10%. We believe this assay can be readily established in many laboratories worldwide at relatively low cost. Development of an improved, high-throughput assay that measures RSV NAbs represents a significant step forward for the standardization of this method internationally as well as being critical for the evaluation of novel RSV vaccine candidates in the future.

298,"Impact of perioperative RSV or influenza infection on length of stay and risk of unplanned ICU admission in children: A case-control study Background: Children with viral respiratory infections who undergo general anesthesia are at increased risk of respiratory complications. We investigated the impact of RSV and influenza infection on perioperative outcomes in children undergoing general anesthesia.Methods: We performed a retrospective case-control study. All patients under the age of 18 years who underwent general anesthesia at our institution with confirmed RSV or influenza infection diagnosed within 24 hours following induction between October 2002 and September 2008 were identified. Controls were randomly selected and were matched by surgical procedure, age, and time of year in a ratio of three controls per case. The primary outcome was postoperative length of stay (LOS).Results: Twenty-four patients with laboratory-confirmed RSV or influenza who underwent general anesthesia prior to diagnosis of viral infection were identified and matched to 72 controls. Thirteen cases had RSV and 11 had influenza. The median postoperative LOS was three days (intra-quartile range 1 to 8 days) for cases and two days (intra-quartile range 1 to 5 days) for controls. Patients with influenza had a longer postoperative LOS (p < 0.001) and patients with RSV or influenza were at increased risk of unplanned admission to the PICU (p = 0.04) than matched controls.Conclusions: Our results suggest that children with evidence of influenza infection undergoing general anesthesia, even in the absence of symptoms previously thought to be associated with a high risk of complications, may have a longer postoperative hospital LOS when compared to matched controls.

299,"Inhaled prostacyclin and high-frequency oscillatory ventilation in a premature infant with respiratory syncytial virus-associated respiratory failure In a 29-day-old premature infant with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) pneumonia, we have shown an additive effect of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) and continuous inhalation of prostacyclin (iPGI2) with improvement of ventilation and oxygenation. The addition of continuous inhaled iPGI2 to HFOV was beneficial in the treatment of hypoxemic respiratory failure owing to RSV-associated pneumonia. The improvement in alveolar recruitment by increasing lung expansion by HFOV along with less ventilation-perfusion mismatch by iPGI2 appears to be responsible for the synergistic effect and favorable clinical outcome. We conclude that the combined therapy of HFOV and continuous inhaled iPGI2 may be considered in RSV-associated hypoxemic respiratory failure in pediatric patients.

300,"Global, regional, and national disease burden estimates of acute lower respiratory infections due to respiratory syncytial virus in children younger than 5 years in 2019: a systematic analysis Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of acute lower respiratory infection in young children. We previously estimated that in 2015, 331 million episodes of RSV-associated acute lower respiratory infection occurred in children aged 060 months, resulting in a total of 118 200 deaths worldwide. Since then, several community surveillance studies have been done to obtain a more precise estimation of RSV associated community deaths. We aimed to update RSV-associated acute lower respiratory infection morbidity and mortality at global, regional, and national levels in children aged 060 months for 2019, with focus on overall mortality and narrower infant age groups that are targeted by RSV prophylactics in development. Methods: In this systematic analysis, we expanded our global RSV disease burden dataset by obtaining new data from an updated search for papers published between Jan 1, 2017, and Dec 31, 2020, from MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health, CINAHL, Web of Science, LILACS, OpenGrey, CNKI, Wanfang, and ChongqingVIP. We also included unpublished data from RSV GEN collaborators. Eligible studies reported data for children aged 060 months with RSV as primary infection with acute lower respiratory infection in community settings, or acute lower respiratory infection necessitating hospital admission; reported data for at least 12 consecutive months, except for in-hospital case fatality ratio (CFR) or for where RSV seasonality is well-defined; and reported incidence rate, hospital admission rate, RSV positive proportion in acute lower respiratory infection hospital admission, or in-hospital CFR. Studies were excluded if case definition was not clearly defined or not consistently applied, RSV infection was not laboratory confirmed or based on serology alone, or if the report included fewer than 50 cases of acute lower respiratory infection. We applied a generalised linear mixed-effects model (GLMM) to estimate RSV-associated acute lower respiratory infection incidence, hospital admission, and in-hospital mortality both globally and regionally (by country development status and by World Bank Income Classification) in 2019. We estimated country-level RSV-associated acute lower respiratory infection incidence through a risk-factor based model. We developed new models (through GLMM) that incorporated the latest RSV community mortality data for estimating overall RSV mortality. This review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021252400). Findings: In addition to 317 studies included in our previous review, we identified and included 113 new eligible studies and unpublished data from 51 studies, for a total of 481 studies. We estimated that globally in 2019, there were 330 million RSV-associated acute lower respiratory infection episodes (uncertainty range [UR] 254446 million), 36 million RSV-associated acute lower respiratory infection hospital admissions (2946 million), 26 300 RSV-associated acute lower respiratory infection in-hospital deaths (15 10049 100), and 101 400 RSV-attributable overall deaths (84 500125 200) in children aged 060 months. In infants aged 06 months, we estimated that there were 66 million RSV-associated acute lower respiratory infection episodes (4697 million), 14 million RSV-associated acute lower respiratory infection hospital admissions (1020 million), 13 300 RSV-associated acute lower respiratory infection in-hospital deaths (680028 100), and 45 700 RSV-attributable overall deaths (38 40055 900). 20% of deaths in children aged 060 months (UR 1624) and 36% of deaths in children aged 28 days to 6 months (3044) were attributable to RSV. More than 95% of RSV-associated acute lower respiratory infection episodes and more than 97% of RSV-attributable deaths across all age bands were in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Interpretation: RSV contributes substantially to morbidity and mortality burden globally in children aged 060 months, especially during the first 6 months of life and in LMICs. We highlight the striking overall mortality burden of RSV disease worldwide, with one in every 50 deaths in children aged 060 months and one in every 28 deaths in children aged 28 days to 6 months attributable to RSV. For every RSV-associated acute lower respiratory infection in-hospital death, we estimate approximately three more deaths attributable to RSV in the community. RSV passive immunisation programmes targeting protection during the first 6 months of life could have a substantial effect on reducing RSV disease burden, although more data are needed to understand the implications of the potential age-shifts in peak RSV burden to older age when these are implemented.

301,"Respiratory syncytial virus outbreak defined by rapid screening in a neonatal intensive care unit Palivizumab is currently licensed for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract disease in infants and children with chronic lung disease, with a history of preterm birth, or with haemodynamically significant congenital heart disease, but its routine use during outbreaks in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) is not currently recommended. Here we report an outbreak in a NICU detected during a screening trial for RSV infection using a rapid antigen test (Respi-Strip()). Eleven preterm infants in our NICU tested positive for RSV during January 2009. Subsequent testing of the remaining infants in the NICU revealed two additional asymptomatic cases. In addition to precautions against cross-infection, palivizumab prophylaxis was administered to the remaining 37 premature infants. Two days after treatment, RSV was detected in two additional infants who had become symptomatic. To our knowledge this is the largest RSV outbreak in a NICU to be identified at an early stage by rapid testing and effectively controlled by infection control measures and palivizumab prophylaxis.  2010 The Hospital Infection Society.

302,"Sucrose stabilization of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) during nebulization and experimental infection. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common respiratory pathogen that can cause severe pneumonia. In vivo studies of RSV can be difficult due to variation in viral infection and disease severity in some animal models. Factors that may contribute to the variation are decreases in viral titer due to preparation and storage and method of virus administration. Nebulization is one method of RSV administration that provides even distribution of virus to all lung lobes; however, the exact quantity of the virus killed by nebulization is not defined. To test the hypothesis that sucrose enhances RSV stability and infectivity, a series of in vitro experiments were conducted with RSV strain Memphis 37 stored at varying concentrations (0%, 3%, 5%, 8%, 10%, 15%, and 20%) of sucrose as a possible cryo- and nebulization protectant. The optimal in vitro concentration was then assessed in vivo in a lamb model. Prior to titering the virus on HEp-2 cells, the various virus solutions were subjected to one freeze-thaw cycle and one nebulization cycle. Forty-eight hours after viral plating, infectious foci were detected and counted using immunofluorescent imaging. Titers were determined after freeze-thaw and after freeze-thaw followed by nebulization, then compared to the stock titers (before freezing) as well as to one another to determine the loss of infectivity. To further test this in vivo, lambs 2 to 3-days-old were infected via nebulization with RSV using inoculate containing either 20% sucrose or no sucrose followed by assessments of infection severity. Nebulization of virus in 0% sucrose resulted in a 0.580 log reduction in infectivity while virus in 20% sucrose exhibited a 0.297 log reduction. In vivo studies demonstrated that 20% sucrose enhanced RSV lesions and antigen distribution. The data suggests that both nebulization and freeze-thawing of RSV in the absence of sucrose cause unacceptable losses in viral infectivity and that sucrose acts as a RSV protectant in both regards.

303,"Respiratory syncytial virus infections in congenital heart defects - Hospitalizations and costs Aims: To register hospitalizations for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections and estimate costs of prophylaxis with humanized monoclonal antibodies (palivizumab) against RSV, compared to hospital care, in cases with congenital heart defects (CHDs). Methods: Population based study with prospective registration of CHDs. Costs for hospital treatment of RSV-infections in CHD-patients calculated by means of the Norwegian Diagnosis Related Groups system. Results: In 43 470 infants live born in the population through the 18-year period 1987-2004 a structural CHD was diagnosed in 527 (1.2%). A total of 898 (2.1%) hospitalizations for RSV-infections occurred in the study population 1987-2005. The hospital admittance rate was significantly higher for CHD-cases (4.8%) than for children without CHD (2%) (P = 0.002). Severe CHDs (need for surgery or catheter intervention) had a higher admittance rate (9.2%) compared to the group of remaining CHDs (3.3%) (P = 0.01). Number needed to treat with palivizumab to avoid one hospitalization for RSV-infection in cases of severe CHDs was calculated to 24, at costs of US$ 195 000. The expenses for palivizuamab prophylaxis in severe CHDs were 31 times that of hospital treatment. Conclusion: Prophylaxis with palivizumab in severe CHDs is not cost-effective.  2006 Taylor & Francis.

304,"Estimating influenza-related sick leave in Norway: Was work absenteeism higher during the 2009 A(H1N1) pandemic compared to seasonal epidemics? The impact of influenza on work absenteeism is poorly documented. We used data from the national registry and Norway Post AS (>14,000 employees) to explore sickness absence patterns from 2005/06 through 2009/10 in Norway. Annually, an estimated 2.868% (mean 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.405-4.820%) of the working population obtained sick leave for influenza, of whom 0.915% (mean 95% CI: 0.453-1.590%) had diagnoses for other respiratory illnesses with influenza as underlying cause. In the 2009/10 pandemic season, the absence rate increased 1.5-fold, mainly due to a 73% increase in influenza-diagnosed sick leaves. At Norway Post AS, absence related to seasonal influenza accounted for 0.351% (mean 95% CI: 0.126-0.704%) of total person-days annually (excluding parental care absence), of which 32-43% were estimated to be self-certified. Medically certified sick leave increased 1.3-fold in the pandemic season to 0.458% (95% CI: 0.176-0.856), while self-certified sick leave remained at a level typical for seasonal influenza. We found a significant four-fold increase in work loss to care for sick children, 0.048% (95% CI: 0.031-0.070%) of person-days, compared with 0.012% (95% CI: 0.004-0.028%) in 2008/09. In conclusion, GP-certified and parental care work absence were higher in the pandemic season. More studies are needed to quantify the burden of self-certified sick leave.

305,"High incidence of pulmonary bacterial co-infection in children with severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of viral lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI). Viral LRTI is a risk factor for bacterial superinfection, having an escalating incidence with increasing severity of respiratory illness. A study was undertaken to determine the incidence of pulmonary bacterial co-infection in infants and children with severe RSV bronchiolitis, using paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission as a surrogate marker of severity, and to study the impact of the co-infection on morbidity and mortality. Methods: A prospective microbiological analysis was made of lower airways secretions on all RSV positive bronchiolitis patients on admission to the PICU during three consecutive RSV seasons. Results: One hundred and sixty five children (median age 1.6 months, IQR 0.5-4.0) admitted to the PICU with RSV bronchiolitis were enrolled in the study. Seventy (42.4%) had lower airway secretions positive for bacteria: 36 (21.8%) were co-infected and 34 (20.6%) had low bacterial growth/possible co-infection. All were mechanically ventilated (median 5.0 days, IQR 3.0-7.3). Those with bacterial co-infection required ventilatory support for longer than those with only RSV (p<0.01). White cell count, neutrophil count, and C-reactive protein did not differentiate between the groups. Seventy four children (45%) received antibiotics prior to intubation. Sex, co-morbidity, origin, prior antibiotics, time on preceding antibiotics, admission oxygen, and ventilation index were not predictive of positive bacterial cultures. There were 12 deaths (6.6%), five of which were related to RSV. Conclusions: Up to 40% of children with severe RSV bronchiolitis requiring admission to the PICU were infected with bacteria in their lower airways and were at increased risk for bacterial pneumonia.

306,"Vaccination against respiratory syncytial virus in pregnancy: a suitable tool to combat global infant morbidity and mortality? Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important viral cause of pneumonia in early childhood (ie, younger than 2 years), responsible for high infant morbidity and mortality worldwide. It is widely accepted that an effective vaccine against RSV would have a major impact on child health globally. Despite the setbacks of the clinical trials in the 1960s, there has been a recent and significant revival of interest in vaccines against RSV, with several promising candidates undergoing evaluation. In this Review, we describe the epidemiological and immunological background to RSV infection and subsequently focus on the promising pipeline of RSV vaccine development. We discuss the potential for implementation of a safe and immunogenic RSV vaccine within the context of global health and with regards to a range of strategies, including vaccination of women during pregnancy, which is likely to emerge as a beneficial and feasible public health tool. This approach would provide interim protection to vulnerable, RSV-naive infants and other high risk groups, in which the burden of admission to hospital and death is greatest. Extending research and implementation from resource-rich to resource-poor settings is required to enhance our understanding of RSV immunity and inform vaccine development and delivery strategies for all settings. We summarise key outstanding issues for researchers and policy makers to understand the interplay of biological and non-biological factors affecting design and distribution of a successful RSV vaccine globally.

307,"Defining the Incidence and Associated Morbidity and Mortality of Severe Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection Among Children with Chronic Diseases Introduction: REGAL (RSV Evidencea Geographical Archive of the Literature) has provided a comprehensive review of the published evidence in the field of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in Western countries over the last 20 years. This review covers the risk and burden of RSV infection in children with underlying medical conditions or chronic diseases (excluding prematurity and congenital heart disease). Methods: A systematic review of publications between January 1, 1995 and December 31, 2015 across PubMed, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and Clinicaltrials.gov was supplemented by papers identified by the authors through March 2017. Studies reporting data for hospital visits/admissions for RSV infection as well as studies reporting RSV-associated morbidity and mortality were included. Study quality and strength of evidence (SOE) were graded. Results: A total of 2703 studies were identified and 58 were included. Down syndrome, irrespective of prematurity and congenital heart disease (moderate SOE), immunocompromised children (low SOE), cystic fibrosis (low SOE), and neurologic conditions (low SOE) were associated with a significantly increased risk of RSV hospitalization. A number of other congenital malformations and chronic conditions were also associated with severe RSV disease (low SOE). In general, pre-existing disease was also a predisposing factor for RSV-related mortality (low SOE). Conclusion: Severe RSV infection in infants and young children with underlying medical conditions or chronic diseases poses a significant health burden. Further studies are needed to fully quantify the epidemiology, burden and outcomes in these populations, in particular RSV-attributable mortality.

308,"Correlation between respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) test data and hospitalization of children for RSV lower respiratory tract illness in Florida Background: Florida experiences year-round outbreaks of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), but it is unknown if there is a correlation between RSV virology data and disease-related hospitalizations. We analyzed RSV surveillance and hospitalization data for the state of Florida to determine if there is an association between seasonal virology data and the incidence of International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, clinical modification (ICD-9-CM) coded hospitalizations for RSV lower respiratory tract illness. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis for each of 5 regions of Florida for 4 years (2001-2004) of monthly RSV surveillance data presented on the Florida Department of Health website and hospitalization data provided by the Agency for Health Care Administration. RSV was considered present when 10% of laboratory tests were positive in a given month and the duration of seasons was determined by the number of consecutive months threshold values were exceeded. Hospitalizations in children 24 months of age and younger were defined as RSV related if any of the following RSV-specific ICD-9-CM codes appeared on the discharge summary: 079.6 RSV; 466.11 acute bronchiolitis caused by RSV; and 480.1 pneumonia caused by RSV. Results: RSV circulated year-round statewide and seasons ranged from 7-8 months in the southwest, northwest, and north regions of Florida to 11-12 months in the central and southeast regions, respectively. More than 23,000 children younger than 24 months of age were hospitalized throughout the state for an RSV-related illness during the 4-year period, with almost 20,000 (86%) of the admissions in infants less than 12 months of age. There were 23 hospitalizations yearly per 1000 births and more than 90% of discharges occurred during the defined RSV seasons. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate a positive correlation between RSV test data and hospitalizations both statewide and for individual regions within Florida. It would be prudent for clinicians to obtain results of local RSV virology data to guide decisions on timing of prophylaxis to prevent RSV hospitalizations. (Light M.)

309,"The epidemiology and clinical characteristics of young children hospitalized with respiratory syncytial virus infections in Guatemala (2007-2010) BACKGROUND: There have been few population-based studies from Central America on respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections in young children. We report population-based incidence rates and describe epidemiological and clinical characteristics of children < 5 years old hospitalized with RSV infections in Guatemala. METHODS: Prospective, active hospital-based surveillance for acute respiratory infections in children <5 years old was conducted at three hospitals in Guatemala from November 2007 through July 2010. RSV hospitalization rates were calculated for areas where the catchment population could be defined. Comparisons were made between children who were RSV-positive and RSV-negative. RESULTS: RSV was detected in 549 (25%) of enrolled children. Overall, annual rates of RSV hospitalizations ranged from 5.9 to 45.9 and 2.0 to 13.7 per 1000 children <1 year old and <5 years old, respectively, but varied by location and calendar year. Rates generally decreased with age-children <6 months had rates up to 30 times higher than older children, but children >12 months old still had rates up to 5.5 per 1000 per year and accounted for 42% of deaths. Children with RSV infections were more likely to have signs of respiratory distress (85% vs. 63%, p<0.001) compared to those without RSV infections, but case fatality ratios were similar (3-4%). CONCLUSIONS: The large burden and severity of RSV infections in young Guatemalan children is similar in magnitude and age distribution to RSV disease burdens found in other developing countries and suggests that this population would benefit from prevention strategies, including vaccines against RSV that are currently under development.

310,"RSV outbreak in a paediatric intensive care unit The Royal Liverpool Children's Hospital-Alder Hey paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) usually has a low rate of nosocomial respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. We report and analyse a major outbreak of nosocomial (acquired) RSV infection on the PICU during a RSV season. All children admitted to the PICU were studied during the six-month winter period 1 October 2002 to 31 March 2002. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were tested using an in vitro enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) membrane test for RSV antigen. PICU-acquired RSV infection was considered to have occurred when a child admitted to the PICU was RSV negative, or from whom no samples were taken as they did not exhibit signs of bronchiolitis, but was RSV positive five or more days after the admission. Fifty-four patients tested RSV positive using the ELISA on the PICU. All the patients were ventilated. Thirty-nine children were RSV positive using the ELISA on admission to the PICU ('imported' cases) and 15 became RSV positive whilst on the PICU ('acquired' cases). The source of the acquired RSV infection accounting for the first peak/outbreak in nosocomial cases were RSV-positive children in isolation cubicles. Acquired cases of RSV infection subsided with reinforcement of traditional methods of barrier precautions. The source of the second peak in nosocomial cases were persistent shedders of RSV. Seventy-three percent (11/15) of the acquired RSV cases had one or more of the following co-morbidities: congenital heart disease, chronic lung disease, airways abnormalities or immunosuppression. Droplet precautions (strict handwashing, use of gloves if handling body fluids, single-use aprons, education) rather than the physical barrier of the cubicle itself played a more important role in curtailing nosocomial spread. Persistent shedders of RSV are an important potential source of nosocomial RSV infection within a PICU. Patients with co-morbidities are at increased risk of nosocomial RSV infection.  2004 The Hospital Infection Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

311,"Opportunities for early therapy of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection: What happens before hospitalization RSV loads of infants are already declining near the time of hospitalization. For optimal effect, antiviral and other RSV therapeutics therefore may need to be applied before this occurs. 134 RSV-hospitalized infants were studied to determine the timing of events and their healthcare seeking behavior prior to hospitalization. Sixty-two percent of infants had contact with a health care professional 1 day prior to hospitalization and 46% had such a contact on 2 different days prior to hospitalization. The mean (S.D.) duration of RSV symptoms prior to hospitalization was 3.92. 3 days and prior to first health care contact was 2.61.8 days. RSV-hospitalized infants routinely have contact with health care professionals at significantly early time points in their illness. These contacts are potential opportunities for initiation of early anti-RSV therapy.  2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. (DeVincenzo J.P., Jdevincenzo@utmem.edu; Aitken J.B.; Harrison L.G.)

312,"Respiratory Syncytial Virus Bronchiolitis in Infancy: The Acute Hospitalization Cost Introduction: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis is among the leading causes of hospitalization in infants. Prophylaxis with palivizumab may reduce RSV infection, but its prescription is restricted to high-risk groups. The aim of the study is to retrospectively determine acute hospitalization costs of bronchiolitis. Materials and methods: Infants aged 1 month1 year, admitted to Bambino Gesu Children Hospital, Rome, Italy, with a diagnosis of bronchiolitis from January 1 till December 31, 2017, were included in the study. Results: A total of 531 patients were enrolled in the study, and the mean age was 78.75 days. The main etiologic agent causing bronchiolitis was RSV, accounting for 58.38% of infections. The total cost of bronchiolitis hospitalization was 2,958,786 euros. The mean cost per patient was significantly higher in the case of RSV (5,753.43  2,041.62 euros) compared to other etiology (5,395.15  2,040.87 euros) (p = 0.04). Discussion: The study confirms the high hospitalization cost associated with bronchiolitis. In detail, in the case of RSV etiology, the cost was higher compared to other etiology, which is likely due to the longer hospitalization and the more frequent admission to the intensive cure department. Conclusion: This study highlights that bronchiolitis is an important cost item even in a tertiary hospital and that cost-effective interventions targeting RSV are increasingly urgent.

313,"Influenza- and respiratory syncytial virus-associated mortality and hospitalisations The aim of the current study was to estimate influenza- and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-associated mortality and hospitalisations, especially the influenza-associated burden among low-risk individuals 65 yrs old, not yet recommended for influenza vaccination in many European countries. Retrospectively during 1997-2003, Dutch national all-cause mortality and hospital discharge figures and virus surveillance data were used to estimate annual average influenza- and RSV-associated excess mortality and hospitalisation using rate difference methods. Influenza virus active periods were significantly associated with excess mortality among 50-64-yr-olds and the elderly, but not in younger age categories. Influenza-associated hospitalisation was highest and about equal for 0-1-yr-olds and the elderly, and also significant for low-risk adults. Hospitalisation among children was mostly due to respiratory conditions, and among adults cardiovascular complications were frequent. RSV-active periods were associated with excess mortality and hospitalisation among the elderly. The highest RSV-related excess hospitalisation was found in 0-1-yr-olds. Influenza-associated mortality was demonstrated in 50-64-yr-olds. Among low-risk individuals 65 yrs of age, influenza-associated hospitalisation rates were highest for 0-4-yr-olds, but also significant for 5-64-yr-olds. These data may further support extension of recommendations for influenza vaccination to include younger low-risk persons. The respiratory syncytial virusassociated burden was highest for young children but also substantial for the elderly. CopyrightERS Journals Ltd 2007.

314,"Temporal association between the influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV): RSV as a predictor of seasonal influenza Epidemiologists agree that there is a prevailing seasonality in the presentation of epidemic waves of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections and influenza. The aim of this study is to quantify the potential relationship between the activity of RSV, with respect to the influenza virus, in order to use the RSV seasonal curve as a predictor of the evolution of an influenza virus epidemic wave. Two statistical tools, logistic regression and time series, are used for predicting the evolution of influenza. Both logistic models and time series of influenza consider RSV information from previous weeks. Data consist of influenza and confirmed RSV cases reported in Comunitat Valenciana (Spain) during the period from week 40 (2010) to week 8 (2014). Binomial logistic regression models used to predict the two states of influenza wave, basal or peak, result in a rate of correct classification higher than 92% with the validation set. When a finer three-states categorization is established, basal, increasing peak and decreasing peak, the multinomial logistic model performs well in 88% of cases of the validation set. The ARMAX model fits well for influenza waves and shows good performance for short-term forecasts up to 3 weeks. The seasonal evolution of influenza virus can be predicted a minimum of 4 weeks in advance using logistic models based on RSV. It would be necessary to study more inter-pandemic seasons to establish a stronger relationship between the epidemic waves of both viruses. (Miguez A.)

315,"Monoclonal antibody for reducing the risk of respiratory syncytial virus infection in children Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the most important viral pathogens causing acute respiratory infections in children. It results in about 3.4 million hospitalisations annually in children under five. Palivizumab is an anti-RSV monoclonal antibody, administered intramuscularly at a dose of 15 mg/kg once every 30 days. The efficacy and safety of palivizumab has been evaluated in multicentre, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and a large number of economic evaluations (EEs) have tested its cost-effectiveness. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness and safety of palivizumab prophylaxis compared with placebo, or another type of prophylaxis, in reducing the risk of complications (hospitalisation due to RSV infection) in high-risk infants and children. To assess the cost-effectiveness (or cost-utility) of palivizumab prophylaxis compared with no prophylaxis in infants and children in different risk groups. Search methods: We searched CENTRAL 2012, Issue 7, MEDLINE (1996 to July week 4, 2012), EMBASE (1996 to August 2012), CINAHL (1996 to August 2012) and LILACS (1996 to August 2012) for studies of effectiveness and safety. We searched the NHS Economic Evaluations Database (NHS EED 2012, Issue 4), Health Economics Evaluations Database (HEED, 9 August 2012) and Paediatric Economic Database Evaluations (PEDE, 1980 to 2009), MEDLINE (1996 to July week 4, 2012) and EMBASE (1996 to August 2012) for economic evaluations. Selection criteria: We included RCTs comparing palivizumab prophylaxis with a placebo, no prophylaxis or another type of prophylaxis in preventing serious lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV in paediatric patients at high risk. We included cost-effectiveness analyses and cost-utility analyses comparing palivizumab prophylaxis with no prophylaxis. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias for the included studies and extracted data for both the RCTs and EEs. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and their associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes and for adverse events (AEs). We provided a narrative summary of results for continuous outcomes, due to missing data on standard deviations. We performed fixed-effect meta-analyses for the estimation of pooled effects whenever there was no indication of heterogeneity between included RCTs. We summarised the results reported in included EEs, such as incremental costs, incremental effectiveness, and incremental cost-effectiveness and/or cost-utility ratios (ICERs), and we calculated ICER present values in 2011 Euros for all studies. Main results: Of the seven available RCTs, three compared palivizumab with a placebo in a total of 2831 patients, and four compared palivizumab with motavizumab in a total of 8265 patients. All RCTs were sponsored by the drug manufacturing company. The overall quality of RCTs was good, but for most of the outcomes assessed only data from two studies contributed to the analysis. Palivizumab prophylaxis was associated with a statistically significant reduction in RSV hospitalisations (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.64) when compared to placebo. When compared to motavizumab, palivizumab recipients showed a non-significant increase in the risk of RSV hospitalisations (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.90). In both cases, the proportion of children with any AE or any AE related to the study drug was similar between the two groups. In terms of economic evidence, we included 34 studies that reported cost-effectiveness and/or cost-utility data for palivizumab prophylaxis compared with no prophylaxis, in high-risk children with different underlying medical conditions. The overall quality of EEs was good, but the variations in modelling approaches were considerable across the studies, leading to big differences in cost-effectiveness results. The cost-effectiveness of palivizumab prophylaxis depends on the consumption of resources taken into account by the study authors; and on the cost-effectiveness threshold set by the healthcare sector in each country. Authors' conclusions: There is evidence that palivizumab prophylaxis is effective in reducing the frequency of hospitalisations due to RSV infection, i.e. in reducing the incidence of serious lower respiratory tract RSV disease in children with chronic lung disease, congenital heart disease or those born preterm. Results from economic evaluations of palivizumab prophylaxis are inconsistent, implying that economic findings must be interpreted with caution. ICER values varied considerably across studies, from highly cost-effective to not cost-effective. The availability of low-cost palivizumab would reduce its inequitable distribution, so that RSV prophylaxis would be available to the poorest countries where children are at greatest risk.

316,"Significance of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in the 1st year of life Background: In this study we investigated the frequency, symptoms and predisposing factors of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection during the 1st year of life in infants with obstructive airway disease in comparison with infants without airway disease. Patients: We enrolled 216 infants in their 1st year of life, who were hospitalized because of obstructive airway disease. As an age- and sex-balanced control group, we examined 133 infants hospitalized for other reasons than airway disease. Method: A deep pharyngeal swab was taken from all infants and immediately examined for the presence of RSV antigen by using an enzyme immunoassay (Directigen). Patient data were surveyed by a questionnaire. Results: The frequency of RSV infections among infants with obstructive airway disease (34.3%; n = 74) differed significantly from the control group (15%; n = 20; p < 0.01). The frequency of RSV-infected infants with obstructive airway disease decreased with age ranging from 39.1% in trimenon I to 29.0% in trimenon IV. This trend was not observed in the central group. With respect to clinical symptoms and risk factors, there were no differences between RSV-infected versus noninfected infants. Conclusion: RSV is an important agent causing lower obstructive airway disease (34.3% of all patients). There are no specific symptoms that can be used for diagnosing RSV infection. In order to prevent other patients on the ward from contracting nosocomial RSV infection and in the light of therapeutic options, one should test newly admitted patients presenting with symptoms of an obstructive airway disease for RSV antigen. On a ward with high-risk patients, we would recommend the use of an RSV test for all new patients. (Gro M.) Am Asbrock 9, D-33611 Bielefeld, Germany. , (Gro M.; Brune T.; Rabe H.)

317,"Evaluating the Individual Healthcare Costs and Burden of Disease Associated with RSV Across Age Groups Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of acute respiratory infection (ARI), with high morbidity and mortality worldwide. RSV costing and burden estimates can highlight the potential benefits of future vaccination programs and are essential for economic evaluations. Objective: We aimed to determine RSV healthcare costs across age groups and the overall disease burden of medically attended RSV in Canada. Methods: We conducted a retrospective casecontrol study to estimate the attributable healthcare costs per RSV case in Alberta. We used two case definitions to capture diversity in case severity: laboratory-confirmed RSV and ARI attributable to RSV. Matching occurred on five criteria: (1) age, (2) urban/rural status, (3) sex, (4) prematurity and (5) Charlson Comorbidity Index score. We calculated the age-specific burden of medically attended RSV in Canada from 2010 to 2019 by multiplying the weekly age-specific incidence of medically attended ARI with the RSV positivity rate. Results: Costs per laboratory-confirmed RSV case were (in Canadian dollars [CAD], year 2020 values) $CAD12,713 and 40,028 in the first 30 and 365 days following diagnosis, respectively, whereas a case of ARI potentially attributable to RSV cost $CAD316 and 915, in 30 and 365 days, respectively. Older (aged  65 years) and younger (aged < 90 days) age groups had the highest case costs. The average medically attended RSV incidence rate across nine seasons was 1743 cases per 100,000 people per year. Conclusions: RSV is a common and expensive infection at the extremes of life, and the development of immunization programs targeting older and younger ages may be important for the reduction of RSV burden and cost.

318,"Rapid testing for respiratory syncytial virus in a paediatric emergency department: Benefits for infection control and bed management Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is responsible for annual winter outbreaks of respiratory tract infection among children in temperate climates, placing severe pressure on hospital beds. Cohorting of affected infants has been demonstrated to be an effective strategy in reducing nosocomial transmission of RSV, and may keep cubicles free for other patients who require them. Testing of symptomatic children for RSV is standard practice, but unfortunately traditional laboratory testing is not rapid enough to aid decision-making processes. Rapid point-of-care testing (POCT) in the emergency department has been suggested as an alternative. We performed a prospective study to quantify the amount of cubicle time saved by using POCT results to allow a targeted cohorting strategy. Over the four-month study period, the POCT allowed 183 children to be admitted directly to a designated cohort area, thus saving 568.5 cubicle-days for other patients. This is equivalent to five cubicles being left free for each day of the study period. This is the first time the benefits of using POCT have been quantified in this way. POCT for RSV is a safe, cost-effective and efficient way to improve bed management.  2010 The Hospital Infection Society. (Mills J.M., jonathan.mills@luht.scot.nhs.uk; Templeton K.E.)

319,"Admission to the intensive care unit for respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis: A national survey before palivizumab use Objective. Preterm infants, especially those with chronic lung disease (CLD), are considered more susceptible to severe respiratory illness from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection than healthy term infants, and are therefore targeted for prophylactic administration of immune globulins. The impact of this practice on the more severe cases of bronchiolitis (ie, pediatric intensive care unit [PICU] admission, mechanical ventilation, mortality) has not been reported to date. The aim of this study was to evaluate PICU admissions, need for mechanical ventilation, and mortality attributable to RSV bronchiolitis in Israel before the introduction of RSV prophylaxis to the country. Design and Setting. Prospective survey of 11 PICUs in Israel during the RSV season (November 2000-March 2001). Patients. All patients admitted to the PICU because of bronchiolitis, and the subgroups who needed mechanical ventilation or who died, were analyzed for known risk factors, namely, prematurity, CLD, and chronic oxygen dependence. Results. A total of 105 patients with RSV bronchiolitis met the inclusion criteria, of whom 33 were mechanically ventilated. Most of the patients (84% total admission, 88% ventilated) were born after 32 weeks' gestation, and 89% and 88%, respectively, did not have CLD. Only 16% and 9%, respectively, met any of the American Academy of Pediatrics criteria for RSV prophylaxis, such that 84% of the whole sample and 91% of the ventilated patients were not candidates for RSV prophylaxis. Five patients died, 2 of them with cyanotic heart disease. Conclusions. Most of the infants with severe RSV bronchiolitis were born at term and did not have CLD. The great majority of patients admitted to the PICU for bronchiolitis were not candidates for RSV prophylaxis. Administration of RSV prophylaxis to the predefined high-risk population could be expected to yield no significant change in PICU admissions or number of infants needing mechanical ventilation. New risk-stratified guidelines for RSV prophylaxis are needed. (Prais D., dariop@clalit.org.il; Amir J.) Department of Pediatrics C, Schneider Childrens Med. Ctr.

321,"Understanding Policy Decisions and Their Implications Regarding Preventive Interventions for Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Infection in Canadian Infants: A Primer for Nurses Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of morbidity and hospitalization in young children, and prevention is the primary management strategy. At present, palivizumab, a monoclonal antibody providing immediate passive immunity, rather than a vaccine that induces active immunity, is the only preventive intervention used in routine practice internationally. In Canada, access varies across the country. Prophylaxis policies are mainly driven by cost-effectiveness analyses, and it is crucial that the full costs and benefits of any intervention are captured. Positive results from a new Canadian cost-effectiveness analysis of palivizumab will help address the current inequality in use while providing a framework for future models of RSV preventives. Nurses are the principal educators for parents about the risks of childhood RSV and optimal prevention via basic hygiene, behavioral and environmental measures, and seasonal prophylaxis. Nurses should be provided not only with regular, up-to-date, and accurate information on RSV and the clinical aspects of emerging interventions but be informed on the decision-making governing the use of preventive strategies.

322,"The Impact of Rapid PCR Testing for Viral Respiratory Infections on Acute Admissions From the Emergency Department and Inpatient Length of Stay Background: Diagnosing influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) with conventional multiplex respiratory viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) takes 24-72 hours compared with under two hours for recently available rapid PCR tests. We investigated the impact of rapid diagnosis of acute respiratory viral infection on admission odds from the emergency department (ED) and acute inpatient length of stay (LOS), as well as concordance between the rapid and conventional PCR tests used at our institution. Methods: Single-center retrospective cohort study of patients presenting to the ED with influenza-like illness. We compared the odds of admission and acute LOS in patients investigated with rapid PCR, those investigated with conventional PCR, and those investigated with both tests. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the odds of admission, while linear regression was used to assess LOS. Results: There was no significant change in the odds of admission among patients who received the rapid PCR compared to conventional PCR (odds ratio: 1.01, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.50-2.02; p = 0.96). There was also no significant difference in LOS of admitted patients who received rapid PCR testing (regression coefficient: -0.32, 95% CI: -1.75 to 1.12; p = 0.66). The rapid PCR test used at our institution yielded fully concordant results with conventional PCR testing. Conclusions: Rapid PCR testing is as sensitive as conventional PCR testing for the diagnosis of influenza and RSV but is neither associated with a significant impact on admission nor inpatient LOS. Further research is needed to assess the impact of rapid testing on isolation room use.

323,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease - new data needed to guide future policy RSV is the main cause of childhood lower respiratory infections, globally, an important cause of childhood wheeze and may be responsible for a substantial burden of disease in the very elderly and in adults with chronic medical problems, such as COPD. It is thus responsible for substantial healthcare and social costs. There are currently many companies and academic groups developing and testing candidate vaccines and there is an expectation that these will lead to effective and safe vaccines which will be available to health systems globally in the short - medium term. Despite this, there is an incomplete understanding of RSV disease, especially in adult groups, and large scale data are only available from a few countries and settings leading to low levels of awareness of the importance of this pathogen. We discuss the need for widespread national sentinel systems of RSV surveillance and some means by which this could be achieved. These data will be needed by national policy makers and immunisation advisory groups to guide future priority setting and decision making. (Campbell H.; Nair H.)

324,"Mortality amongst patients with influenza-associated severe acute respiratory illness, South Africa, 2009-2013 Introduction: Data on the burden and risk groups for influenza-associated mortality from Africa are limited. We aimed to estimate the incidence and risk-factors for in-hospital influenza-associated severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) deaths. Methods: Hospitalised patients with SARI were enrolled prospectively in four provinces of South Africa from 2009- 2013. Using polymerase chain reaction, respiratory samples were tested for ten respiratory viruses and blood for pneumococcal DNA. The incidence of influenza-associated SARI deaths was estimated at one urban hospital with a defined catchment population. Results: We enrolled 1376 patients with influenza-associated SARI and 3% (41 of 1358 with available outcome data) died. In patients with available HIV-status, the case-fatality proportion (CFP) was higher in HIV-infected (5%, 22/419) than HIV-uninfected individuals (2%, 13/620; p = 0.006). CFPs varied by age group, and generally increased with increasing age amongst individuals >5 years (p<0.001). On multivariable analysis, factors associated with death were age-group 45-64 years (odds ratio (OR) 4.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-16.3) and 65 years (OR 6.5, 95%CI 1.2-34.3) compared to 1-4 year age-group who had the lowest CFP, HIV-infection (OR 2.9, 95%CI 1.1-7.8), underlying medical conditions other than HIV (OR 2.9, 95%CI 1.2-7.3) and pneumococcal co-infection (OR 4.1, 95%CI 1.5-11.2). The estimated incidence of influenza-associated SARI deaths per 100,000 population was highest in children <1 year (20.1, 95%CI 12.1-31.3) and adults aged 45-64 years (10.4, 95%CI 8.4-12.9). Adjusting for age, the rate of death was 20-fold (95%CI 15.0-27.8) higher in HIV-infected individuals than HIV-uninfected individuals. Conclusion: Influenza causes substantial mortality in urban South Africa, particularly in infants aged <1 year and HIV-infected individuals. More widespread access to antiretroviral treatment and influenza vaccination may reduce this burden.

325,"Respiratory syncytial virus morbidity and outpatient palivizumab dosing in South Carolina, 2004-2009 OBJECTIVE: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has been identified as an important cause of lower respiratory tract disease in infants. In patients at high risk, prevention is attempted through immunoprophylaxis with palivizumab. In 2008, as a result of revisions to the American Academy of Pediatrics' guidelines, South Carolina Medicaid reduced the number of approved palivizumab doses from six to five. This study attempted to determine whether the reduction of approved doses would affect hospitalization and emergency department visits and to characterize dose administration. METHODS: We obtained data for all South Carolina Medicaid reimbursed births from November 2004 through March 2009. For each RSV season, infants who should have received palivizumab were identified. Rates of outpatient palivizumab dosing and hospitalizations and emergency department visits because of RSV also were identified. RESULTS: In the seasons sampled, 1956 infants met eligibility criteria for our study. Infants younger than 29 weeks' gestation received 34% to 48% of their total eligible palivizumab doses, whereas infants 29 to 31 weeks' gestation received 36% to 46% of their doses. The rate of emergency department visits and inpatient admissions because of RSV did not differ significantly across years. DISCUSSION: In evaluating our primary outcome, there was no increase in hospitalizations or emergency department visits. Overall, we did note a poor dosing rate in all of the groups. A statistically significant decline in dosing per eligible month was noted following the dose reductions. Despite solid evidence of the benefits of palivizumab in high-risk groups, we are doing an inadequate job of dosing these patients. CONCLUSIONS: We believe adherence to current recommendations for palivizumab dosing is suboptimal in preterm infants insured by the South Carolina Medicaid program. Healthcare professionals must work harder to identify and follow-up with patients who qualify for palivizumab dosing, including infants who meet criteria for a second season.  2012 by The Southern Medical Association.

326,"Epidemiological aspects of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections in Italy: A national survey Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of respiratory infections such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia in babies and children, producing serious infections and short- to medium-term complications. We conducted a survey, using a questionnaire, to determine the opinions of paediatricians on the geographical and seasonal distribution, and the clinical impact of RSV in Italy. Of the 344 paediatricians who responded, 66% had admitted children affected by RSV into their department, and 38% of these had admitted more than 10 cases during the preceding year. According to those interviewed, newborn babies of lowest gestational age were most often affected. The children considered to be at highest risk of severe infection were those with bronchodysplasia, immunodeficiencies or congenital heart disease; most admissions (87%) were attributed to bronchiolitis. In southern Italy and the islands RSV appeared later and persisted later into the year than in central and northern Italy. Most paediatricians (79%) considered the available treatments for serious RSV ineffective but only half were aware of the possibility of immunoprophylaxis against RSV. (Alvaro G.)

327,"Prevalence and genetic characterization of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in hospitalized children in Korea Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is the most common respiratory pathogen among infants and young children. To investigate the prevalence and genetic characteristics of HRSVs circulating in South Korea, we analyzed medical records of patients and performed molecular analysis of the G-protein gene of viruses detected from nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) of admitted patients at the Pediatrics Department of Chungbuk National University Hospital from April 2008 to April 2010. Epidemiological data revealed that the prevalence of HRSV infection was high during both winter seasons (October 2008 to February 2009 and November 2009 to February 2010). Of the 297 positive NPA specimens from infants or children tested, 67% were identified as HRSV-A while 33% were HRSV-B. The HRSV subgroup B was the most dominant in December 2008, but its dominance was dramatically replaced by HRSV subgroup A strains by February 2009. Phylogenetic analysis of the G protein sequences of HRSVs revealed novel genotypes within the HRSV-A (genotype CB-A) and B (genotypes BA11 and CB-B) subgroups in South Korea in addition to other strains identified in other countries. Molecular analysis also revealed genetic variability at the C-terminal end of the G proteins of the two HRSV subgroups, suggesting selection pressure in this region, which may potentially impact immune recognition. This is the first report of these HRSV variants in South Korea, indicating active genetic evolution of HRSV strains. Therefore, this study provides information on the molecular epidemiology of current HRSVs in the country and presents data for comparative analysis with other HRSV strains circulating worldwide.  2012 Springer-Verlag.

328,"New Inhibitors of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Replication Based on Monoterpene-Substituted Arylcoumarins Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes annual epidemics of respiratory infection. Usually harmless to adults, the RSV infection can be dangerous to children under 3 years of age and elderly people over 65 years of age, often causing serious problems, even death. At present, there are no vaccines and specific chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of this disease, so the search for low-molecular weight compounds to combat RSV is a challenge. In this work, we have shown, for the first time, that monoterpene-substituted arylcoumarins are efficient RSV replication inhibitors at low micromolar concentrations. The most active compound has a selectivity index of about 200 and acts most effectively at the early stages of infection. The F protein of RSV is a potential target for these compounds, which is also confirmed by molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation data.

329,"Review of epidemiology and clinical risk factors for severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is the most frequent reason for hospitalization of infants in developed countries. Premature birth without or, especially, with chronic lung disease of prematurity, congenital heart disease, and T-cell immunodeficiency are conditions that predispose to more severe forms of RSV infection. Incomplete development of the airway, damage to the airway, and airway hyperreactivity underlie the increased morbidity of RSV infection in prematurely born infants. Pulmonary hypertension and cyanosis are associated with worse outcomes in infants with congenital heart disease, and prolonged viral replication accounts for more severe illness in immunocompromised individuals.

330,"Transaminase levels reflect disease severity in children ventilated for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis Bronchiolitis, often caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), is the commonest cause of hospitalisation in infancy. Serum transaminases are sometimes raised in children with bronchiolitis. We tested the hypothesis that raised transaminases are associated with increased disease severity in children ventilated for bronchiolitis. Prospective observational cohort study of mechanically ventilated children with community-acquired RSV bronchiolitis. Alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) levels were measured daily. Children with normal transaminases were compared with those with elevated levels. Over 11 consecutive winters, 556 children with RSV bronchiolitis were mechanically ventilated - 226 had comorbidities and therefore excluded; 313 of remaining 330 were under 2 years age; 305 had early transaminase measurements. 57/305 (19%) had elevated transaminase (AST and/or ALT) levels. For the first time we show that duration of ventilation and length of admission were both significantly longer, and paediatric index of mortality and C-reactive protein higher, in those with elevated AST levels on admission (but not those with elevated ALT levels). Furthermore, transaminase elevations were transient, generally having normalised by seven days following admission. RSV bronchiolitis was more severe in children with early elevated AST levels and could be used early in the illness as a predictor for disease severity.

331,"Clinical course of community-acquired respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia in newborns hospitalized in neonatal intensive care unit Introduction: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of pneumonia in infants worldwide. We aimed to evaluate the clinical course of community-acquired RSV pneumonia in newborns hospitalized in neonatal intensive care unit. Materials and Methods: All the newborns diagnosed as pneumonia were prospectively evaluated for RSV infection between November 2010 and April 2011. Fifty-four specimens of nasopharyngeal secretions were tested in parallel with the RAT and the multiplex real time polymerase chain reaction (RT- PCR). Downes' score was used to assess the disease severity in patients with pneumonia. Results: RAT has a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 78.5%, as the PCR technique target assay. Four of the patients with RSV pneumonia had secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) and all of four needed mechanical ventilation support. The first day Downes' score was positively correlated with time of intravenous fluid requirement (p= 0.001, r= 0.48), total oxygen need (p= 0.000, r= 0.63), and re-enteral feeding (p= 0.001, r= 0.46). Blood pH (p= 0.031, r= 0.46) were negatively correlated with Downes' score. The second day Downes' score was higher in patients with ASD than those of without ASD (3.8  2.6 vs. 2  1.1, p= 0.01). The most possible risk factor for longer hospital stay was the higher second day Downes' score (p= 0.02 OR: 1.9, CI 95% (1.1-3.2). All infants were discharged from hospital in a good health. Conclusion: RAT is sensitive and specific in detecting RSV infections in newborns. Physicians may use Downes' score for evaluation of disease severity in infants with RSV pneumonia. In these patients, ASD has increased the disease severity.

332,"Global molecular epidemiology of respiratory syncytial virus from the 2017-2018 INFORM-RSV study Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection among infants and young children, resulting in annual epidemics worldwide. INFORM-RSV is a multiyear clinical study designed to describe the global molecular epidemiology of RSV in children under 5 years of age by monitoring temporal and geographical evolution of current circulating RSV strains, F protein antigenic sites, and their relationships with clinical features of RSV disease. During the pilot season (2017-2018), 410 RSV G-F gene sequences were obtained from 476 RSVpositive nasal samples collected from 8 countries (United Kingdom, Spain, The Netherlands, Finland, Japan, Brazil, South Africa, and Australia). RSV B (all BA9 genotype) predominated over RSV A (all ON1 genotype) globally (69.0% versus 31.0%) and in all countries except South Africa. Geographic clustering patterns highlighted wide transmission and continued evolution with viral spread. Most RSV strains were from infants of <1 year of age (81.2%), males (56.3%), and patients hospitalized for >24 h (70.5%), with no differences in subtype distribution. Compared to 2013 reference sequences, variations at F protein antigenic sites were observed for both RSV A and B strains, with high-frequency polymorphisms at antigenic site  (I206M/Q209R) and site V (L172Q/S173L/K191R) in RSV B strains. The INFORM-RSV 2017-2018 pilot season establishes an important molecular baseline of RSV strain distribution and sequence variability with which to track the emergence of new strains and provide an early warning system of neutralization escape variants that may impact transmission or the effectiveness of vaccines and MAbs under development.

333,"Reversible disruption of XPO1-mediated nuclear export inhibits respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) replication Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the primary cause of serious lower respiratory tract disease in infants, young children, the elderly and immunocompromised individuals. Therapy for RSV infections is limited to high risk infants and there are no safe and efficacious vaccines. Matrix (M) protein is a major RSV structural protein with a key role in virus assembly. Interestingly, M is localised to the nucleus early in infection and its export into the cytoplasm by the nuclear exporter, exportin-1 (XPO1) is essential for RSV assembly. We have shown previously that chemical inhibition of XPO1 function results in reduced RSV replication. In this study, we have investigated the anti-RSV efficacy of Selective Inhibitor of Nuclear Export (SINE) compounds, KPT-335 and KPT-185. Our data shows that therapeutic administration of the SINE compounds results in reduced RSV titre in human respiratory epithelial cell culture. Within 24 h of treatment, RSV replication and XPO1 expression was reduced, M protein was partially retained in the nucleus, and cell cycle progression was delayed. Notably, the effect of SINE compounds was reversible within 24 h after their removal. Our data show that reversible inhibition of XPO1 can disrupt RSV replication by affecting downstream pathways regulated by the nuclear exporter.

335,"Mortality in children hospitalised with respiratory syncytial virus infection in Singapore INTRODUCTION This study aimed to investigate the trend and seasonality of infection due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) at KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH) in Singapore and to examine the risk factors for mortality among children with RSV infection requiring admission to the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU). METHODS A retrospective study was conducted at KKH on children with RSV infections who were admitted to the PICU between January 2004 and December 2010. The medical records of children who died from RSV infections were reviewed. Linear regression was performed to determine the risk factors for RSV mortality. RESULTS RSV infection was documented in 5,785 children during the study period; the infection was noted to be occurring throughout the year, with a small increase in prevalence between the months of June and August every year. Among 85 (1.5%) out of 5,785 children who were admitted to the PICU for RSV infection, 74 (1.3%) survived and 11 (0.2%) died. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that haemodynamically significant cardiac disease (odds ratio [OR] 12.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.9-16.7, p = 0.05), immunodeficiency (OR 71.4, 95% CI 8.2-500, p < 0.001) and metabolic disease (OR 71.4, 95% CI 4.3-1,000, p = 0.003) were independent risk factors for mortality in RSV infections. Prematurity increased the risk of admission to the PICU but was not significantly associated with mortality. CONCLUSION Children with haemodynamically significant cardiac disease, immunodeficiency and metabolic disease were at higher risk of death after hospitalisation for RSV-related illnesses. These children should be considered for palivizumab prophylaxis.

336,"Cost determinants among adults hospitalized with respiratory syncytial virus in the United States, 20172019 Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections are common in adults, but data describing the cost of RSV-associated hospitalization are lacking due to inconsistency in diagnostic coding and incomplete case ascertainment. We evaluated costs of RSV-associated hospitalization in adult patients with laboratory-confirmed, community-onset RSV. Methods: We included adults  18 years of age admitted to three hospital systems in New York during two RSV seasons who were RSV-positive by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and had more than or equal to two acute respiratory infection symptoms or exacerbation of underlying cardiopulmonary disease. We abstracted costs from hospital finance systems or converted hospital charges to cost using cost-charge ratios. We converted cost into 2020 US dollars and extrapolated to the United States. We used a generalized linear model to determine predictors of hospitalization cost, stratified by admission to intensive care units (ICU). Results: Cost data were available for 79% (601/756) of eligible patients. The mean total cost of hospitalization was $8403 (CI(95) $7240$9741). The highest costs were those attributed to ICU services $7885 (CI(95) $5877$10,240), whereas the lowest were radiology $324 (CI(95) $275$376). Other than longer length of stay, predictors of higher cost included having chronic liver disease (odds ratio [OR] 1.38 [CI(95) 1.051.80]) for patients without ICU admission and antibiotic use (OR 1.49 [CI(95) 1.102.03]) for patients with ICU admission. The annual US cost was estimated to be $1.2 (CI(95) 0.91.4) billion. Conclusion: The economic burden of RSV hospitalization of adults  18 years of age in the United States is substantial. RSV vaccine programs may be useful in reducing this economic burden.

Eligible infants were under 5 months old and admitted betweem November 1998 and October 1999 with respiratory failure, apnoea and/or bradycardia or acute life threatening episodes (ALTE). We diagnosed RSV by PCR analysis of nasopharyngeal aspirate, and in contacts by PCR of pernasal swabs. Of the 137 eligible infants, 66% (91/137) were recruited; of these, 82% (75/91) had RSV, with 47% (35/75) diagnosed by hospital laboratory tests and 93% (70/75) by PCR. The median duration of ventilation was 4.4 days, the length of stay on PICU, 8.6 days, and the length of stay in hospital, 15.9 days. In most families (62%), the parents and siblings developed symptoms of RSV infection at the same time as the infant. When the index infant was a secondary case, primary cases occurred in both older siblings (16 families) and adults (11 families). Silent RSV infection occurred frequently amongst children and adults. RSV is under-diagnosed in PICUs. PCR increases the rate of diagnosis of RSV compared to routine hospital diagnostic methods. Young infants are most often infected at the same time as or before their parents and siblings, indicating that the source may be outside the household; vaccinating family members may not prevent RSV infection in infants.  2007 Springer-Verlag.

339,"Modelling the impact of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine and immunoprophylaxis strategies in New Zealand Background: Mathematical models of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) transmission can help describe seasonal epidemics and assess the impact of potential vaccines and immunoprophylaxis with monoclonal antibodies (mAb). Methods: We developed a deterministic, compartmental model for RSV transmission, which was fitted to population-based RSV hospital surveillance data from Auckland, New Zealand. The model simulated the introduction of either a maternal vaccine or a seasonal mAb among infants aged less than 6 months and estimated the reduction in RSV hospitalizations for a range of effectiveness and coverage values. Results: The model accurately reproduced the annual seasonality of RSV epidemics in Auckland. We found that a maternal vaccine with effectiveness of 3040% in the first 90 days and 1520% for the next 90 days could reduce RSV hospitalizations by 1824% in children younger than 3 months, by 1114% in children aged 35 months, and by 23% in children aged 623 months. A seasonal infant mAb with 4060% effectiveness for 150 days could reduce RSV hospitalizations by 3043%, 3448% and by 1421% in children aged 02 months, 35 months and 623 months, respectively. Conclusions: Our results suggest that either a maternal RSV vaccine or mAb would effectively reduce RSV hospitalization disease burden in New Zealand. Overall, a seasonal mAb resulted in a larger disease prevention impact than a maternal vaccine. (Prasad N., namrata.prasad@esr.cri.nz; Waite B.; Huang Q.S.; Newbern E.C.)

340,"Risk of bacterial infection in previously healthy respiratory syncytial virus-infected young children admitted to the intensive care unit Objective: To evaluate the risk of bacterial infection and use of antibiotics in otherwise healthy children infected with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Methods: Demographics, clinical information, interventions and outcomes were extracted from the charts of consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed RSV infection at Children's Hospital, Boston from October 1990 through April 2002. Patients born at <36 weeks gestational age or with preexisting medical conditions were excluded. Results: The median age of the 165 previously healthy infants infected with RSV was 42 days. Almost all patients received supplementary FiO(2), and 63 (38.2%) patients required mechanical ventilator support. No patients died. The median length of stay was 3 days in the ICU and 7 days in the hospital. Most patients had bacterial cultures sent: 155 (93.9%), blood cultures; 121 (73.3%), urine cultures; and 85 (51.5%) cerebrospinal fluid cultures. Only 1 blood culture was positive, and 1 potential urinary tract infection was identified in a patient with a negative urinalysis. All intubated patients and 80.4% of nonintubated patients received antibiotic therapy. Conclusions: In otherwise healthy infants admitted to the ICU with RSV infection, bacteremia, urinary tract infection and meningitis are uncommon. Although bacterial pneumonia in this cohort may be more prevalent, overdiagnosis is common. Copyright  2004 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. (Reder L.)

341,"Modeling the Potential Impact of the 2014 American Academy of Pediatrics Respiratory Syncytial Virus Prophylaxis Guidance on Preterm Infant RSV Outcomes Introduction: The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Committee on Infectious Diseases issued updated guidance on respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) prophylaxis in 2014. This report models the potential impact of the new guidance on RSV outcomes in preterm infants 2934 weeks gestational age (wGA) without chronic lung disease in the United States. Methods: The number of preterm infants was estimated using 2012 natality data. Palivizumab utilization prior to the 2014 guidance update was estimated using 20132014 specialty pharmacy utilization data. Low, moderate, and high RSV hospitalization (RSVH) rates as well as average hospital length of stay, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and mechanical ventilation (MV) frequencies were derived from published observational studies. Palivizumab efficacy was derived from two randomized clinical trials. RSV events that would be attributable to the 2014 guidance change were calculated for preterm infants 2931 and 3234 wGA. Results: Annual number of infants 2934 wGA surviving the neonatal period was estimated at 123,687. Of these, an estimated 44,712 (37%) would receive palivizumab based on the 2012 guidance. The annual number of RSVH among infants 2934 wGA would increase from 3580 under the 2012 guidance to 6166 under the 2014 guidance based on moderate rates. This would result in an additional 24,440 hospitalization days, 1162 ICU admissions, and 584 MV events among this population. Conclusions: Based on published historical and contemporary data on RSVH rates in preterm infants 2934 wGA, the 2014 AAP guidance is expected to result in additional burden to the healthcare system and families of preterm infants. The impact of the new guidance will be difficult to detect among the overall infant population, particularly in settings without routine testing for RSV, but the impact will be substantial for the small high-risk population affected by the changes.

342,"Nasal High Frequency Oscillatory Ventilation for Respiratory Failure due to Respiratory Syncytial Virus Bronchiolitis: Case Report The authors describe a case of acute respiratory failure due to severe bronchiolitis. During high-flow nasal cannula ventilation, the blood's high levels of hypercapnia had taken them to plan the sedation and the orotracheal intubation. However, before attempting intubation, a nasal high frequency oscillatory ventilation cycle was performed and it led to a marked improvement in the blood gas, avoiding in this way the invasive ventilation.

343,"Severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in infants with neuromuscular diseases and immune deficiency syndromes Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an important cause of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in infants and children. There is growing evidence of severe RSV disease in infants with neuromuscular diseases and immune deficiency syndromes. Factors predisposing to a more severe course of RSV disease in neuromuscular diseases include the impaired ability to clear secretions from the airways due to ineffective cough, respiratory muscle weakness, high prevalence of gastro-oesophageal reflux and swallowing dysfunction which leads to aspiration. Similarly, pulmonary disease is a common presenting feature and complication of T-cell immunodeficiency. Infants with severe congenital and acquired immune deficiency syndromes may demonstrate prolonged viral shedding in RSV LRTI and are reported to have increased morbidity and mortality associated with RSV infection. Although not indicated in most guideline statements, palivizumab prophylaxis for these uncommon underlying conditions is under consideration by clinicians. Prospective studies are needed to determine the burden of RSV disease in these children.  2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

344,"CT-morphological characterization of respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) pneumonia in immune-compromised adults Purpose: Characterization and follow-up evaluation of chest CT of RSV pneumonia in immune-compromised adults during a seasonal epidemic. Materials and Methods: Retrospective analysis of 132 chest CT examinations of 51 adult immune-compromised patients (29 m/22f, O58 years) with clinical signs of pneumonia and positive RSV test in winter 2011/2012. Two experienced chest radiologists evaluated the morphology (bronchial wall thickening, tree-in-bud, nodules, halo, ground-glass opacities, consolidations, pleural fluid) of the CT scans by consensus. Results: Pathological findings were in 86 % of the chest CT scans: Areas of ground-glass attenuation in 64 %, consolidations in 56 %, nodules in 55 % (O 8 mm in maximal diameter, with halo in 71 %), pleural fluid in 44 % (O 2 cm), tree-in-bud in 36 %, bronchial wall thickening in 27 % and more than one morphological finding in 72 %. There were no pathological CT findings in 14 % of patients with clinical symptoms of pneumonia because these patients did not undergo follow-up. Radiological progression was found in 45 % of patients and regression in 33 % in follow-up examinations. In 37 % an additional examination of the paranasal sinuses was performed and showed sinusitis in 63 % of cases. 90 % of the patients had sinusitis as well as pneumonia. In addition to RSV, a further pathogenic agent was found in bronchoalveolar lavage of five patients (Aspergillus spec., herpes simplex virus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Conclusion: The most characteristic signs in chest CT scans were at the beginning of pneumonia with nodules and tree-in-bud often combined with bronchial wall thickening. The following CT scans showed characteristic but not pathognomonic chest CT findings of RSV pneumonia. These morphological findings should be recognized seasonally (winter) especially at the beginning of the case of pneumonia. RSV-associated additional sinusitis is probably common and should be noticed. Key Points:  The most characteristic signs in chest CT scans were at the beginning of RSV pneumonia with nodules and tree-in-bud; we suppose that the pneumonia is run through different CT morphological phases.  The following CT scans showed less characteristic and multiple CT variations most frequently ground glass and nodules.  Negative thoracic CT were seen only in a little part of RSV positive patients with symptoms of pneumonia.  An additional RSV-associated sinusitis should be in mind.

345,"A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of dexamethasone in severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection: Effects on RSV quantity and clinical outcome Forty-one previously healthy children < 2 years of age who required mechanical ventilation for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection were randomized to receive dexamethasone (0.5 mg/kg; n = 22) or saline placebo (n = 19) intravenously every 12 h for 4 days. RSV quantity was measured by quantitative plaque assay in fresh tracheal and nasal aspirates obtained at intervals of 24  3 h on days 0, 1, 2, 5, and 7 following entry. Analysis by linear mixed-effects modeling demonstrated a significantly greater decline in mean tracheal RSV quantity in the placebo group than in the dexamethasone group from day 0 to day 1 (0.82 vs. 0.21 log pfu/mL; P= .01) and from day 0 to day 2 (1.45 vs. 0.53 log pfu/mL; P= .03). No differences were found between groups in nasal RSV quantity, white blood cell counts in tracheal or nasal aspirates, serum neutralizing antibody titers during convalescence, or duration of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit stay, or hospital stay.

346,"Respiratory syncytial virus-associated mortality in hospitalized infants and young children BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common cause of pediatric hospitalization, but the mortality rate and estimated annual deaths are based on decades-old data. Our objective was to describe contemporary RSV-associated mortality in hospitalized infants and children aged <2 years.METHODS: We queried the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Kids' Inpatient Database (KID) for 2000, 2003, 2006, and 2009 and the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) administrative data from 2000 to 2011 for hospitalizations with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis codes for RSV infection and mortality.RESULTS: The KID data sets identified 607 937 RSV-associated admissions and 550 deaths (9.0 deaths/10 000 admissions). The PHIS data set identified 264 721 RSV-associated admissions and 671 deaths (25.4 deaths/10 000 admissions) (P < .001 compared with the KID data set). The 2009 KID data set estimated 42.0 annual deaths (3.0 deaths/10 000 admissions) for those with a primary diagnosis of RSV. The PHIS data set identified 259 deaths with a primary diagnosis of RSV, with mortality rates peaking at 14.0/10 000 admissions in 2002 and 2003 and decreasing to 4.0/ 10 000 patients by 2011 (odds ratio: 0.27 [95% confidence interval: 0.14-0.52]). The majority of deaths in both the KID and PHIS data sets occurred in infants with complex chronic conditions and in those with other acute conditions such as sepsis that could have contributed to their deaths.CONCLUSIONS: Deaths associated with RSV are uncommon in the 21st century. Children with complex chronic conditions account for the majority of deaths, and the relative contribution of RSV infection to their deaths is unclear.

347,"Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) in infants hospitalized for acute lower respiratory tract disease: Incidence and associated risks Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the main causes of acute lower respiratory tract infections worldwide. We examined the incidence and associated risks for RSV infection in infants hospitalized in two university hospitals in the state of Sao Paulo. We made a prospective cohort study involving 152 infants hospitalized for acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRTI) in two university hospitals in Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil, between April and September 2004. Clinical and epidemiological data were obtained at admission. RSV was detected by direct immunofluorescence of nasopharyngeal secretions. Factors associated with RSV infection were assessed by calculating the relative risk (RR). The incidence of RSV infection was 17.5%. Risk factors associated with infection were: gestational age less than 35 weeks (RR: 4.17; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.21-7.87); birth weight less than or equal to 2,500 grams (RR: 2.69; 95% CI 1.34-5.37); mother's educational level less than five years of schooling (RR: 2.28; 95% CI 1.13-4.59) and pulse oximetry at admission to hospital lower than 90% (RR: 2.19; 95% CI 1.10-4.37). Low birth weight and prematurity are factors associated with respiratory disease due to RSV in infants. Low educational level of the mother and poor socioeconomic conditions also constitute risk factors. Hypoxemia in RSV infections at admission indicates potential severity and a need for early oxygen therapy.  2006 by The Brazilian Journal of Infectious Diseases and Contexto Publishing.

349,"Respiratory syncytial virus morbidity, premorbid factors, seasonality, and implications for prophylaxis Objectives: We investigated factors associated with morbidity and pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission in children with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection and explored seasonality and implication of prophylaxis. Methods: A retrospective study between 2006 and 2008 of every child with a laboratory-confirmed RSV infection was included. Results: Six hundred seventy RSV admissions were identified. Ten (1.5%) required PICU admissions. Children admitted to PICU were younger than non-PICU admissions (median [interquartile range] age, 0.3 [0.11-0.48] vs 1.18 [0.46-2.49] years; P = .001). Odds associated with PICU admissions included history of chronic lung disease (odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 18.08 [2.29-114.95]; P = .010), history of acyanotic heart disease (7.61 [1.04-42.59], P = .043), and neurodevelopmental conditions (mental retardation, cerebral palsy, or neuromuscular disease; 8.41 [1.63-38.57], P = .012). Odds of bacterial coinfections was 13.50 (1.77-81.29), P = .017. There appeared no significant PICU predilection in terms of sex, history of prematurity, cyanotic heart disease, seizure disorders, chromosomal disorders, or malignancy. Admissions associated with proven RSV infections accounted for 2.4% of PICU annual admissions. The duration of PICU stay was generally brief (median, 3 days). However, median length of hospital stay was significantly longer in the PICU category (8.5 vs 3 days, P < .001). There was no death in the study period. Only 5 (0.75%) of 665 patients were readmitted to the pediatric infectious disease isolation ward in consecutive years, and none required PICU support. Twenty (3%) of admissions involved neonates younger than 30 days. There was no definite seasonality, but incidence was lowest between October and January. Conclusions: Most infants have mild disease and do not require PICU support. Young infants with history of chronic lung disease, congenital heart disease, and neurodevelopmental conditions appear to be at significantly increased risk for PICU support. There is no winter seasonality for RSV disease in Hong Kong. Therefore, any prophylaxis for at-risk population should provide adequate coverage for the warmer months in subtropical regions.  2012 Elsevier Inc. (Hon K.L., ehon@hotmail.com; Leung T.F.)

352,"Unnecessary antibiotic treatment of children hospitalised with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis: risk factors and prescription patterns Objectives: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of respiratory tract infections, especially in young children. Antibiotics are often unnecessarily prescribed for the treatment of RSV. Such treatments affect antibiotic resistance in future bacterial infections of treated patients and the general population. This study aimed to understand risk factors for and patterns of unnecessary antibiotic prescription in children with RSV. Methods: In a single-centre, retrospective study in Israel, we obtained data for children aged 2 years (n = 1016) hospitalised for RSV bronchiolitis during 20082018 and ascertained not to have bacterial co-infections. Antibiotic misuse was defined as prescription of antibiotics during hospitalisation of the study population. Demographic and clinical variables were assessed as predictors of unnecessary antibiotic treatment in a multivariable logistic regression model. Results: The unnecessary antibiotic treatment rate of children infected with RSV and ascertained not to have a bacterial co-infection was estimated at 33.4% (95% CI 30.536.4%). An increased likelihood of antibiotic misuse was associated with drawing bacterial cultures and with variables indicative of a severe patient status such as lower oxygen saturation, higher body temperature, tachypnoea and prior recent emergency room visit. Older age and female sex were also associated with an increased likelihood of unnecessary antibiotic treatment. Conclusions: Unnecessary antibiotic treatment in RSV patients was very common and may be largely attributed to physicians perception of patients severity. Improving prescription guidelines, implementing antibiotic stewardship programmes and utilising decision support systems may help achieve a better balance between prescribing and withholding antibiotic treatment.

354,"Absence of association between cord specific antibody levels and severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease in early infants: A case control study from coastal Kenya Background: The target group for severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease prevention is infants under 6 months of age. Vaccine boosting of antibody titres in pregnant mothers could protect these young infants from severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) associated disease. Quantifying protective levels of RSV-specific maternal antibody at birth would inform vaccine development. Methods: A case control study nested in a birth cohort (2002-07) was conducted in Kilifi, Kenya; where 30 hospitalised cases of RSV-associated severe disease were matched to 60 controls. Participants had a cord blood and 2 subsequent 3-monthly blood samples assayed for RSV-specific neutralising antibody by the plaque reduction neutralisation test (PRNT). Two sample paired t test and conditional logistic regression were used in analyses of log(2)PRNT titres. Results: The mean RSV log(2)PRNT titre at birth for cases and controls were not significantly different (P = 0.4) and remained so on age-stratification. Cord blood PRNT titres showed considerable overlap between cases and controls. The odds of RSV disease decreased with increase in log(2)PRNT cord blood titre. There was a 30% reduction in RSV disease per unit increase in log(2)PRNT titre (<3months age group) but not significant (P = 0.3). Conclusions: From this study, there is no strong evidence of protection by maternal RSV specific antibodies from severe RSV disease. Cord antibody levels show wide variation with considerable overlap between cases and controls. It is likely that, there are additional factors to specific PRNT antibody levels which determine susceptibility to severe RSV disease. In addition, higher levels of neutralizing antibody beyond the normal range may be required for protection; which it is hoped can be achieved by a maternal RSV vaccine.

355,"Interaction between healthcare professionals and parents is a key determinant of parental distress during childhood hospitalisation for respiratory syncytial virus infection (European RSV Outcomes Study [EROS]) Aim: We characterised the distress that parents experienced when their child was hospitalised for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. Methods: This survey-based, observational study was conducted during 20142015. Meetings were held in Spain and Italy, with 24 parents of RSV hospitalised infants and 11 healthcare professionals experienced in RSV, which identified 110 factors related to parental distress. The resulting questionnaire was completed by another 105 Spanish and Italian parents and 56 healthcare professionals, to assess the impact these factors had on parental distress, using a scale from 0 to 10 (very unimportant to very important). Results: The five most important factors for parents were: healthcare professionals awareness of the latest developments, readmission, reinfections, painful procedures and positive experiences with healthcare professionals. Healthcare professionals associated only medical factors with a meaningful impact on parents. Half of the six medical factors were given similar importance by both groups and the overall scoring for the 110 factors was comparable, with a correlation coefficient of 0.80. A primary concern on discharge was ongoing support. Conclusion: The relationship between parents and healthcare professionals was a significant factor in determining parental distress. Healthcare professionals appeared to have a good understanding of the overall impact on parents, particularly the key medical factors.

358,"A classification study of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) inhibitors by variable selection with random forest Experimental pEC(50)s for 216 selective respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) inhibitors are used to develop classification models as a potential screening tool for a large library of target compounds. Variable selection algorithm coupled with random forests (VS-RF) is used to extract the physicochemical features most relevant to the RSV inhibition. Based on the selected small set of descriptors, four other widely used approaches, i.e., support vector machine (SVM), Gaussian process (GP), linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and k nearest neighbors (kNN) routines are also employed and compared with the VS-RF method in terms of several of rigorous evaluation criteria. The obtained results indicate that the VS-RF model is a powerful tool for classification of RSV inhibitors, producing the highest overall accuracy of 94.34% for the external prediction set, which significantly outperforms the other four methods with the average accuracy of 80.66%. The proposed model with excellent prediction capacity from internal to external quality should be important for screening and optimization of potential RSV inhibitors prior to chemical synthesis in drug development.  2011 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

359,"Parental knowledge about respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and attitudes to infant immunization with monoclonal antibodies Background: Ninety percent of children are infected with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) within their first two years of life. RSV is the main cause behind hospitalization of infants with lower respiratory tract infections. A new monoclonal antibody (mAb) immunization may prevent RSV in all infants. This cross-national study aimed to examine parental knowledge about RSV and attitudes to such RSV immunization. Research design and methods: Based on a literature study, a questionnaire was designed and applied in a survey carried out in China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, the UK, and the US. Eligible respondents were expecting their first baby or parents of children <24 months old who were open to vaccination. Results: Parental acceptance of immunizations relies on perceptions of the preventable disease. In 5627 parents, only 35% reported basic or good level of knowledge about RSV. Recommendation from health care professionals and inclusion in immunization programs were crucial to their acceptance of RSV immunization. If recommended and informed about its efficacy and safety, most parents would accept RSV mAb immunization for their infants. Conclusions: Infant RSV infections are highly prevalent, yet parental awareness of RSV is poor. Country variations call for targeted communication about RSV and immunization.

360,"Multicentered study of viral acute lower respiratory infections in children from four cities of Argentina, 1993-1994 This study describes the first multicentered study of acute lower respiratory infection viral etiology in young children from four different geographical areas of Argentina. A total of 1,278 children under 5 years of age, hospitalized in primary care centers from Buenos Aires, Cordoba, Santa Fe and Mar del Plata cities during a 2-year period were studied (1993-1994). Nasopharyngeal aspirates were investigated for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, parainfluenza, and influenza A and B viruses by indirect immunofluorescence. Out of the patients studied, 946(74%)were under 1 year of age. Viruses were detected in 399 patients (32%). RSV was observed in 25.3% of the samples, representing 78.2% of all viral positive cases. Adenoviruses were detected in 2.5% of the cases, parainfluenza in 2.2%, influenza A in 2.1%, and influenza B in 0.2%. Compared with other viruses, the higher RSV frequency was statistically significant (P<0.000). Most RSV cases were detected between May and September with a significant peak in July (P<0.000). Pneumonia was observed in 46% of the patients, bronchiolitis in 41% and other entities in 13%. The case fatality rate observed during the 2 year study was 0.73%. Most of the above respiratory viruses were detected in the four cities, however, the frequency of RSV and influenza were different in the southern city.  2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

361,"Stochastic modeling of the transmission of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in the region of Valencia, Spain In this paper, we study the dynamics of the transmission of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in the population using stochastic models. The stochastic models are developed introducing stochastic perturbations on the demographic parameter as well as on the transmission rate of the RSV. Numerical simulations of the deterministic and stochastic models are performed in order to understand the effect of fluctuating birth rate and transmission rate of the RSV on the population dynamics. The numerical solutions of stochastic models are calculated using Euler-Maruyama and Milstein schemes, and confidence intervals for stochastic solutions are given using Monte-Carlo method. Analysis of the numerical results reveals that perturbations on the transmission rate are more decisive in the dynamics of RSV than perturbations on demographic parameters. In addition, the stochastic models show the advantage of reproducing more effectively the noisy RSV hospitalization data. It is concluded that these stochastic models are a viable option to provide a realistic modeling of the RSV dynamics on the population.  2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

362,"Palivizumab - The humanised monoclonal antibody for prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection RSV is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infections in infants. The humanised monoclonal antibody has been developed for prevention of serious lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV. Palivizumab specifically inhibits subtypes A and B. In a large, multicenter, double- blind, randomised trial in 1502 infants at high risk of RSV infection, intramuscular palivizumab 15 mg/kg reduced the incidence of RSV-attributable hospitalization by 55% compared with placebo. Palivizumab was well tolerated. In Germany palivizumab prophylaxis should be considered only for high risk premature infants and high risk infants with chronic lung disease if the local rate of hospitalization attributable to confirmed RSV infection is frequent.

363,"Oral ribavirin for respiratory syncytial virus infection after lung transplantation: Efficacy and cost-efficiency Background Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes serious respiratory tract infections in lung transplant (LTx) recipients, is associated with development of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, and has no proven effective therapy. We evaluated the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of oral ribavirin for the treatment of RSV infection after LTx. Methods Between December 2011 and May 2014, 52 LTx recipients developed 56 episodes of symptomatic RSV infection, which was diagnosed by positive RSV polymerase chain reaction on nasopharyngeal swabs. An intravenous (IV) loading dose of ribavirin (33 mg/kg) was given in 52 of 56 episodes; an equivalent oral loading dose was given in 2 episodes. Oral ribavirin (20 mg/kg/day) was given by day 2 in 53 of 56 episodes. Median duration of therapy was 8 days (range 6-31 days). Results Mean forced expiratory volume in 1 sec decreased from 2.38  0.78 liters to 2.07  0.85 liters (p < 0.001) at presentation, recovered to 2.26  0.82 liters at cessation of ribavirin, and was maintained at 2.31  0.81 liters within 3 months. New-onset bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome developed in 1 of 38 patients (2.6%) at 3 months. Anemia worsened in 23 episodes, and de novo anemia developed in 5 episodes. Mean hemoglobin decreased from 118  16 g/liter to 113  21 g/liter (p = 0.015). There were 4 late deaths. Compared with IV therapy, mean drug cost saving was US $6,035 per episode, and mean inpatient bed days was reduced by 6.7 days (p < 0.001). Conclusions To our knowledge, we report the largest series of LTx recipients treated with oral ribavirin for RSV. Oral ribavirin appears to be an effective, well-tolerated alternative to IV or inhaled ribavirin; provides considerable cost savings and reduces length of hospital stay. Potential long-term benefits in preventing development of chronic lung allograft dysfunction are yet to be determined. (Burrows F.S., fay.burrows@svha.org.au; Carlos L.M.)

364,"Clinical Characteristics and Course of Infections by Influenza A- and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) in Hospitalized Adults There is little evidence on the clinical characteristics and the course of complicated infections with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) compared to influenza A in adults. Therefore, the present monocenter study aims to compare infections with RSV and influenza A with regard to potential predisposing factors, clinical profile, course and outcome in hospitalized patient. Material and methods the study was performed between Jan 1th and March 31 this year and included all hospitalized patients with a Polymerase chain-reaction-(PCR) confirmed infection of influenza A and RSV. Patients were characterized by clinical symptoms at the time of diagnosis, laboratory parameters of inflammation and potential predisposing factors like chronical diseases of heart, lung, kidney, metabolism and tumors. Data on the length of hospital stay, origin of infection (nosocomial), rate of pneumonia, antimicrobial use, need of mechanical ventilation and hospital mortality were obtained to evaluate clinical severity and outcome. Results A total of 190 patients with Influenza A and 98 patients with RSV were included. Both patient groups did not differ with regard to anthropometric data and clinical symptoms: it was surprising to see that only 2/3 oft all patients exert symptoms of a respiratory infection. 15.3% of influenza A and 13.3% RSV infections were defined as being nosocomial. Comparing the clinical course and outcome, patients with RSV infections and chronical disease of the lung had an increased rate of mechanical ventilations (odds ratio 10.55 [95% CI 1.18-507.1] p=0.014). Conclusions The present data clearly show that RSV is a frequent pathogen in hospitalized adults with complicated infections in the winter season. RSV infections seems to be more severe compared to influenza A particular in patients with chronic lung disease, but were as frequent as influenza A of nosocomial origin. In this context, an early diagnosis seems to be helpful for a successful infections prevention management under hospital conditions.

365,"Health economics and RSV An economic analysis was performed in Spain to evaluate the efficiency (cost-effectiveness) of palivizumab in preventing severe RSV infection in premature infants with GA 32-35 and two or more risk factors (RF). The design was a decision tree model using data from the scientific literature and the FLIP I and FLIP II studies IRIS Study Group. The main effectiveness measure was quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained from both the National Health System (NHS) and societal perspectives. Prophylaxis with palivizumab was found to produce an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 13,849/QALY from the NHS perspective, and 4,605/QALY from the societal perspective. Palivizumab is a cost-effective therapy as prophylaxis against RSV in infants with GA 32-35 and two or more RF. Its use is efficient from the NHS perspective, since the cost of a QALY, even in the least favourable scenarios, is lower than the threshold of 30,000/QALY considered socially acceptable in Europe.  2009 Elsevier Ltd.

366,"Challenges in Maximizing Impacts of Preventive Strategies against Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Disease in Young Children Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract illness in infants and young children. It causes substantial morbidity and mortality in young children and older adults. As few therapeutic and prophylaxis options against RSV illness are currently available, there is a great need for effective RSV vaccines and immune-prophylaxis. Encouragingly, multiple vaccines and immuno-prophylaxis aiming to protect pediatric populations have shown promising progress in clinical trials. The three major preventive strategies include RSV F-protein-based vaccines for pregnant women, extended half-life monoclonal antibodies for neonates, and live-attenuated vaccines for infants. Each preventive strategy has its own merits and challenges yet to be overcome. Challenges also exist in maximizing vaccine impacts in the post-implementation era. This perspectives piece focuses on RSV preventive strategies in young children and highlights the remaining questions in current development of RSV immunization products and design of immunization programs.

368,"Prevalence of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) risk factors and cost implications of immunoprophylaxis to infants 32 to 35 weeks gestation for health plans in the United States Background: During the period of this study, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) 2006 guidelines recommended respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) prophylaxis for infants 32 to 35 weeks gestation age (wGA) with two or more of five risk factors (RFs). New recommendations have recently been published in 2009. The cost implications of expanding this list of RFs to include other evidence-based RFs like passive smoke exposure (PSE), crowded living conditions (CLCs), and young chronological age (YCA) are unclear. Methods: We estimated the prevalence of RSV RFs in a US sample of infants 32 to 35 wGA referred for prophylaxis from nine specialty pharmacy providers during the 2007-2008 season. We estimated the percent eligible for RSV prophylaxis under various potential RF coverage policies. Using a budget impact model, we calculated the per-member-per-month (PMPM) cost for each policy in 2007 USD for a hypothetical one million member plan. Results: Infants 32 to 35 wGA represented 0.08% of the plan. Approximately 20.2% of these infants met at least two or more of five AAP RFs. Expanding this list to include one additional RF of PSE, CLC, or YCA increased the percent of infants potentially prophylaxed to 29.9%, 23.9%, and 47%, respectively. Adding all three RFs to the list (two or more of eight) increased the percent of infants potentially prophylaxed to 55.6%, and increased payer costs by 9 cents PMPM. Conclusion: Expanding the AAP RF criteria to include PSE, CLC, and YCA would identify more 32 to 35 wGA infants at high risk for severe RSV disease at an acceptable budget impact.  2009, International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR).

369,"Airway gene-expression classifiers for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease severity in infants Background: A substantial number of infants infected with RSV develop severe symptoms requiring hospitalization. We currently lack accurate biomarkers that are associated with severe illness. Method: We defined airway gene expression profiles based on RNA sequencing from nasal brush samples from 106 full-tem previously healthy RSV infected subjects during acute infection (day 110 of illness) and convalescence stage (day 28 of illness). All subjects were assigned a clinical illness severity score (GRSS). Using AIC-based model selection, we built a sparse linear correlate of GRSS based on 41 genes (NGSS1). We also built an alternate model based upon 13 genes associated with severe infection acutely but displaying stable expression over time (NGSS2). Results: NGSS1 is strongly correlated with the disease severity, demonstrating a naive correlation () of  = 0.935 and cross-validated correlation of 0.813. As a binary classifier (mild versus severe), NGSS1 correctly classifies disease severity in 89.6% of the subjects following cross-validation. NGSS2 has slightly less, but comparable, accuracy with a cross-validated correlation of 0.741 and classification accuracy of 84.0%. Conclusion: Airway gene expression patterns, obtained following a minimally-invasive procedure, have potential utility for development of clinically useful biomarkers that correlate with disease severity in primary RSV infection.

370,"Predictors of asthma following severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis in early childhood Background: We sought to identify predictors of asthma development following severe early childhood RSV bronchiolitis. Different definitions of asthma were also compared. Methods: This longitudinal, observational study (N = 343) followed patients (<2 years old) from a placebo-controlled trial (N = 979) of montelukast after RSV bronchiolitis to identify clinical, demographic, or biochemical predictors of asthma, atopic disorders, and chronic asthma therapy use at 6 years of age (Clinical Trials Registry Number: NCT01140048). Asthma (primary definition) was based on parental identification of wheeze at 6 AND 12 months before 6 years of age; definitions based on physician diagnosis as well as parental identification of wheeze at 6 OR 12 months (to consider seasonal effect) were also assessed. Post-hoc analyses evaluated agreement among asthma diagnosis criteria. Results: Prevalence of asthma (primary definition by parental identification), asthma (physician diagnosis), atopic disorders, and chronic asthma therapy use (parental identification) was 6.1%, 22.4%, 36.2%, and 14.5%, respectively. Predictors for asthma (primary definition) included male gender, a relative with asthma, and RAST positive for dog dander; for physician diagnosis of asthma, high severity score for RSV bronchiolitis, high respiratory rate, and asthma diagnosis before enrollment. Predictors of atopic disorders included allergic rhinitis before enrollment, a relative with asthma, and the plasma biomarkers IL-5, IL-16, and IL-18. Predictors of chronic asthma therapy use included asthma diagnosis before enrollment and geographic region (Europe and Africa). Only 42% of patients with asthma (primary definition) also met the asthma definition by physician diagnosis and chronic asthma therapy use. Conclusion: Among children with early RSV bronchiolitis, hereditary factors (i.e., having a relative with asthma) and RSV bronchiolitis severity were predictors of asthma and atopic disorders at 6 years of age.

371,"A multicenter consortium to define the epidemiology and outcomes of inpatient respiratory viral infections in pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients Background. Respiratory virus infections (RVIs) pose a threat to children undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In this era of sensitive molecular diagnostics, the incidence and outcome of HSCT recipients who are hospitalized with RVI (H-RVI) are not well described. Methods. A retrospective observational cohort of pediatric HSCT recipients (between January 2010 and June 2013) was assembled from 9 US pediatric transplant centers. Their medical charts were reviewed for H-RVI events within 1 year after their transplant. An H-RVI diagnosis required respiratory signs or symptoms plus viral detection (human rhinovirus/enterovirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza, parainfluenza, coronaviruses, and/or respiratory syncytial virus). The incidence of H-RVI was calculated, and the association of baseline HSCT factors with subsequent pulmonary complications and death was assessed. Results. Among 1560 HSCT recipients, 259 (16.6%) acquired at least 1 H-RVI within 1 year after their transplant. The median age of the patients with an H-RVI was lower than that of patients without an H-RVI (4.8 vs 7.1 years; P < .001). Among the patients with a first H-RVI, 48% required some respiratory support, and 14% suffered significant pulmonary sequelae. The all-cause and attributable case-fatality rates within 3 months of H-RVI onset were 11% and 5.4%, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that H-RVI onset within 60 days of HSCT, steroid use in the 7 days before H-RVI onset, and the need for respiratory support at H-RVI onset were associated with subsequent morbidity or death. Conclusion. Results of this multicenter cohort study suggest that H-RVIs are relatively common in pediatric HSCT recipients and contribute to significant morbidity and death. These data should help inform interventional studies specific to each viral pathogen.

372,"Mortality in children from influenza and respiratory syncytial virus Study objective: To quantify mortality attributable to influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in children. Design and methods: Comparison of death rates (all cause and certified respiratory) in England over winters 1989/90 to 1999/00 during and outside influenza and RSV circulation periods. Virus active weeks were defined from clinical and virological surveillance data. Excess deaths associated with weeks of either influenza or RSV activity over virus non-active weeks were estimated in each winter for age groups 1-12 months, 1-4, 5-9, and 10-14 years. The estimate obtained was allotted to influenza and RSV in the proportion derived from independent separate calculations for each virus. Main results: Average winter respiratory deaths attributed to influenza in children 1 month-14 years were 22 and to RSV 28; and all cause deaths to influenza 78 and to RSV 79. All cause RSV attributed deaths in infants 1-12 months exceeded those for influenza every year except 1989/90; the average RSV and influenza attributed death rates were 8.4 and 6.7 per 100 000 population respectively. Corresponding rates for children 1-4 years were 0.9 and 0.8 and for older children all rates were 0.2 or less, except for an influenza rate of 0.4 in children 10-14 years. Conclusions: Influenza and RSV account for similar numbers of deaths in children. The impact varies by winter and between age groups and is considerably underestimated if analysis is restricted to respiratory certified deaths. Summing the impact over the 11 winters studied, compared with influenza RSV is associated with more deaths in infants less than 12 months, almost equal numbers in children 1-4 years, and fewer in older children. Improved information systems are needed to investigate paediatric deaths.

373,"Frequency of respiratory syncytial virus infection among patients hospitalized for influenza-like diseases and its impact on mortality: Prospective, multi-center real life results Introduction: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is among the major causes of severe mortality and morbidity in both children and adults worldwide. This study aimed at demonstrating the course of RSV in our country. Materials and Methods: Simultaneous RSV surveillance was implemented within the scope of Global Influenza Hospital Surveillance Network in Ankara in the season of 2016-2017. Results: A total of 917 cases were included into the study, and RSV polymerase chain reaction was positive in 145 patients (15.8%). Among the RSV positive cases, 132 were under five years old and 13 were over five. There was no underlying disease in 86.3% of the cases under five years of age, and the most common underlying disease was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the five years and older group. While 9.8% of the cases under the age of five was admitted to the intensive care unit, only one case out of 13 patients over the age of five was admitted to the intensive care unit. Although the rate of infection was higher among children under five years of age, there was one mortal case in this group, while one of two patients older than 65 years died in the group over the age of five. Conclusion: In our country, clinical and epidemiological data have great importance for the prevention of mortality and morbidity associated with RSV infections, and extensive surveillance studies are needed.

374,"Wastewater Surveillance Data as a Complement to Emergency Department Visit Data for Tracking Incidence of Influenza A and Respiratory Syncytial Virus - Wisconsin, August 2022-March 2023 Wastewater surveillance has been used to assist public health authorities in tracking local transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The usefulness of wastewater surveillance to track community spread of other respiratory pathogens, including influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), is less clear. During the 2022-23 respiratory diseases season, concentrations of influenza A virus and RSV in wastewater samples in three major Wisconsin cities were compared with emergency department (ED) visits associated with these pathogens. In all three cities, higher concentrations of influenza A virus and RSV in wastewater were associated with higher numbers of associated ED visits (Kendall's tau range = 0.50-0.63 for influenza-associated illness and 0.30-0.49 for RSV-associated illness). Detections of both influenza A virus and RSV in wastewater often preceded a rise in associated ED visits for each pathogen, and virus material remained detectable in wastewater for up to 3 months after pathogen-specific ED visits declined. These results demonstrate that wastewater surveillance has the potential to complement conventional methods of influenza and RSV surveillance, detecting viral signals earlier and for a longer duration than do clinical data. Continued use of wastewater surveillance as a supplement to established surveillance systems such as ED visits might improve local understanding and response to seasonal respiratory virus outbreaks.

375,"Parental emotional and time costs predict compliance with respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis Background. - Two agents are effective in preventing respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) hospitalization in premature infants: RSV immune globulin (RSV-IG) and palivizumab. RSV-IG is associated with greater parental emotional and time costs, which may account for the more limited adherence to recommended monthly treatment with this agent. Objectives. - To compare the emotional distress and time costs associated with RSV-IG and palivizumab treatments and to determine the influence of these costs on treatment adherence. Methods. - We surveyed parents of 82 infants who received RSV-IG (90% of eligible) and parents of 61 infants who received palivizumab (87% of eligible) at Arkansas Children's Hospital by telephone. We measured infant distress during treatment, parental distress, parental time costs, and adherence with recommended monthly prophylaxis. Results. - Half of parents of RSV-IG recipients witnessed their infant in distress during infusion, over half (61%) were upset by observing the needle stick, and 22% observed infusion in the scalp. Fewer than 5% of parents of palivizumab recipients observed their infant in distress or were themselves distressed during treatment. A quarter of parents took time off from work for RSV-IG or palivizumab treatment. RSV-IG recipients completed 62% of recommended monthly treatments compared with 86% completed by palivizumab recipients. Increased parental distress and time costs largely accounted for the reduction in adherence to monthly treatment among RSV-IG recipients. Conclusions. - The emotional and time costs of RSV-IG treatment far exceed those of palivizumab and predict substantial differences in treatment adherence between the 2 agents. The impact of hidden costs on treatment adherence should be included in economic evaluations of medical procedures.

376,"Temporal trends of respiratory syncytial virus-associated hospital and ICU admissions across the United States Objectives: To describe the regionality and seasonality of respiratory syncytial virus-associated hospital and ICU admissions for 10 consecutive years using a national database. Design: Post hoc analysis of data from an existing national database, Pediatric Health Information System. We modeled the adjusted odds of hospital and ICU admissions for varied seasons (fall, winter, spring, and summer) and regions (Northeast, South, Midwest, and West) using a mixed-effects logistic regression model after adjusting for several patient and center characteristics. Setting: Forty-two children's hospitals across the Unites States. Patients: Patients 1 day through 24 months old with inpatient admission (ward and/or ICU) for respiratory syncytial virus- associated infection at a Pediatric Health Information System-participating hospital were included (2004-2013). Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Of 1,937,994 inpatient admissions during the study period, 146,357 children were admitted for respiratory syncytial virus-associated acute respiratory illness. Of these inpatient admissions, 32,470 children(22%) were admitted to ICU during their hospital stay. Overall adjusted odds of respiratory syncytial virus-associated hospital and ICU admissions in recent years (2010-2013) were higher than previous years (2004-2006 and 2007-2009). In recent years, respiratory syncytial virus-associated hospital and ICU admissions have increased in winter and spring seasons. Regionally in recent years, the overall adjusted odds of both respiratory syncytial virus-associated hospital and ICU admissions have increased in the South and West regions. Conclusions: Wide variations in regional and seasonal patterns in hospital and ICU admissions were noted in children with respiratory syncytial virus-associated acute respiratory illness across the United States. Results from our study help us better understand the seasonality and regionality of respiratory syncytial virus infection in the United States with the goal to decrease the financial impact on our already stressed healthcare system by being better prepared for respiratory syncytial virus season.

377,"Novel respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) genotype ON1 predominates in germany during winter season 2012-13 Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of hospitalization especially in young children with respiratory tract infections (RTI). Patterns of circulating RSV genotypes can provide a better understanding of the molecular epidemiology of RSV infection. We retrospectively analyzed the genetic diversity of RSV infection in hospitalized children with acute RTI admitted to University Hospital Heidelberg/Germany between October 2012 and April 2013. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) were routinely obtained in 240 children younger than 2 years of age who presented with clinical symptoms of upper or lower RTI. We analyzed NPAs via PCR and sequence analysis of the second variable region of the RSV G gene coding for the attachment glycoprotein. We obtained medical records reviewing routine clinical data. RSV was detected in 134/240 children. In RSV-positive patients the most common diagnosis was bronchitis/bronchiolitis (75.4%). The mean duration of hospitalization was longer in RSV-positive compared to RSV-negative patients (3.5 vs. 5.1 days; p<0.01). RSV-A was detected in 82.1%, RSV-B in 17.9% of all samples. Phylogenetic analysis of 112 isolates revealed that the majority of RSV-A strains (65%) belonged to the novel ON1 genotype containing a 72-nucleotide duplication. However, genotype ON1 was not associated with a more severe course of illness when taking basic clinical/laboratory parameters into account. Molecular characterization of RSV confirms the co-circulation of multiple genotypes of subtype RSV-A and RSV-B. The duplication in the G gene of genotype ON1 might have an effect on the rapid spread of this emerging RSV strain.

378,"Anticipated costs of hospitalization for respiratory syncytial virus infection in young children at risk Background: Reliable estimates of hospitalization costs for severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection are necessary to perform economic analyses of preventive strategies of severe RSV disease. We aimed to develop a model that predicts anticipated mean RSV hospitalization costs of groups of young children at risk for hospitalization, but not yet hospitalized, based on readily available child characteristics. Methods: We determined real direct medical costs of RSV hospitalization from a societal perspective, using a bottom-up strategy, in 3458 infants and young children hospitalized for severe RSV disease during the RSV seasons 1996-1997 to 1999-2000 in the Southwest of the Netherlands. We used a linear regression model to predict anticipated mean RSV hospitalization costs of groups of children at risk, based on 4 child characteristics [age, gestational age, birth weight and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)], expressed in EC Euros as of the year 2000. Findings: The mean RSV hospitalization costs of all patients were 3110. RSV hospitalization costs were higher for patients with lower gestational age (5555; gestational age, 28 weeks), lower birth weight (3895; birth weight 2500 g), BPD (5785; with BPD) and young age (4730; first month of life). The linear regression model had an adjusted R(2) of 0.08. This indicates a low explanatory ability for hospitalization costs of individual children. However, the model could accurately estimate the anticipated mean hospitalization costs of groups of children with the same characteristics. Interpretation: RSV hospitalization costs were substantial, especially of specific high risk groups. Anticipated mean hospitalization costs of groups of children at risk for RSV hospitalization, but not yet hospitalized, could well be estimated with 4 child characteristics (age, gestational age, birth weight and BPD). These estimated costs can be used for economic analyses of preventive strategies for severe RSV disease. (Rietveld E.; Moll H.A.)

379,"Biomarkers of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection: Specific neutrophil and cytokine levels provide increased accuracy in predicting disease severity Despite fundamental advances in the research on respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) since its initial identification almost 60 years ago, recurring failures in developing vaccines and pharmacologic strategies effective in controlling the infection have allowed RSV to become a leading cause of global infant morbidity and mortality. Indeed, the burden of this infection on families and health care organizations worldwide continues to escalate and its financial costs are growing. Furthermore, strong epidemiologic evidence indicates that early-life lower respiratory tract infections caused by RSV lead to the development of recurrent wheezing and childhood asthma. While some progress has been made in the identification of reliable biomarkers for RSV bronchiolitis, a ""one size fits all"" biomarker capable of accurately and consistently predicting disease severity and post-acute outcomes has yet to be discovered. Therefore, it is of great importance on a global scale to identify useful biomarkers for this infection that will allow pediatricians to cost-effectively predict the clinical course of the disease, as well as monitor the efficacy of new therapeutic strategies.

380,"Mortality due to respiratory syncytial virus burden and risk factors Rationale: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most frequent cause of hospitalization and an important cause of death in infants in the developing world. The relative contribution of social, biologic, and clinical risk factors to RSV mortality in low-income regions is unclear. Objectives: To determine the burden and risk factors for mortality due to RSV in a low-income population of 84,840 infants. Methods: This was a prospective, population-based, crosssectional, multicenter study conducted between 2011 and 2013. Hospitalizations and deaths due to severe lower respiratory tract illness (LRTI) were recorded during the RSV season. All-cause hospital deaths and community deaths were monitored. Risk factors for respiratory failure (RF) and mortality due to RSV were assessed using a hierarchical, logistic regression model. Measurements and Main Results: A total of 2,588 (65.5%) infants with severe LRTI were infected with RSV. A total of 157 infants (148 postneonatal) experienced RF or died with RSV. RSV LRTI accounted for 57% fatal LRTI tested for the virus. A diagnosis of sepsis (odds ratio [OR], 17.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 13.14-21.16 for RF) (OR, 119.39; 95% CI, 50.98-273.34 for death) and pneumothorax (OR, 17.15; 95% CI, 13.07-21.01 for RF) (OR, 65.49; 95% CI, 28.90-139.17 for death) were the main determinants of poor outcomes. Conclusions: RSV was the most frequent cause of mortality in lowincome postneonatal infants. RF and death due to RSV LRTI, almost exclusively associated with prematurity and cardiopulmonary diseases in industrialized countries, primarily affect term infants in a developing world environment. Poor outcomes at hospitals are frequent and associated with the cooccurrence of bacterial sepsis and clinically significant pneumothoraxes.

384,"Developing a prediction model to estimate the true burden of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in hospitalised children in Western Australia Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of childhood morbidity, however there is no systematic testing in children hospitalised with respiratory symptoms. Therefore, current RSV incidence likely underestimates the true burden. We used probabilistically linked perinatal, hospital, and laboratory records of 321,825 children born in Western Australia (WA), 2000-2012. We generated a predictive model for RSV positivity in hospitalised children aged < 5 years. We applied the model to all hospitalisations in our population-based cohort to determine the true RSV incidence, and under-ascertainment fraction. The model's predictive performance was determined using cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve. From 321,825 hospitalisations, 37,784 were tested for RSV (22.8% positive). Predictors of RSV positivity included younger admission age, male sex, non-Aboriginal ethnicity, a diagnosis of bronchiolitis and longer hospital stay. Our model showed good predictive accuracy (AUROC: 0.87). The respective sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive values were 58.4%, 92.2%, 68.6% and 88.3%. The predicted incidence rates of hospitalised RSV for children aged < 3 months was 43.7/1000 child-years (95% CI 42.1-45.4) compared with 31.7/1000 child-years (95% CI 30.3-33.1) from laboratory-confirmed RSV admissions. Findings from our study suggest that the true burden of RSV may be 30-57% higher than current estimates. (Gebremedhin A.T., Amanuel.gebremedhin@telethonkids.org.au; Blyth C.C.; Moore H.C.)

385,"Level of maternal antibodies against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) nucleoprotein at birth and risk of RSV very severe lower respiratory tract infection Background: The nucleoprotein (N protein) of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a candidate antigen for new RSV vaccine development. The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between maternal antibody titers against the RSV N protein at birth and the newborns' risk of developing very severe lower respiratory tract infection (VS-LRTI). Methods: In this single-center prospective cohort study, 578 infants born during the RSV epidemic season in France were included. Among these, 36 were hospitalized for RSV VS-LRTI. A generalized linear model was used to test the occurrence of a VS-LRTI in function of sex, mode of delivery, parity of the mother, type of pregnancy, date of birth in relation to the peak of the epidemic, and antibody titer against N protein. Results: All cord blood samples had detectable antibodies against N protein. The mean titers were significantly lower in newborns with risk factors for RSV severe LRTI (preterm infants, birth before the peak epidemic, multiparous mother). There was no association between antibody titer against the N protein and a protection against VS-LRTI. Conclusions: Further studies are needed to support the hypothesis that transfer of maternal antibodies against the RSV N protein can provide a significant immune protection early in infancy and that N protein candidate vaccine may be a suitable target for maternal vaccine.

387,"Burden of hospital admissions caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in infants in England: A data linkage modelling study Objectives: Current national estimates of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-associated hospital admissions are insufficiently detailed to determine optimal vaccination strategies for RSV. We employ novel methodology to estimate the burden of RSV-associated hospital admissions in infants in England, with detailed stratification by patient and clinical characteristics. Methods: We used linked, routinely collected laboratory and hospital data to identify laboratory-confirmed RSV-positive and RSV-negative respiratory hospital admissions in infants in England, then generate a predictive logistic regression model for RSV-associated admissions. We applied this model to all respiratory hospital admissions in infants in England, to estimate the national burden of RSV-associated admissions by calendar week, age in weeks and months, clinical risk group and birth month. Results: We estimated an annual average of 20,359 (95% CI 19,236-22,028) RSV-associated admissions in infants in England from mid-2010 to mid-2012. These admissions accounted for 57,907 (95% CI 55,391-61,637) annual bed days. 55% of RSV-associated bed days and 45% of RSV-associated admissions were in infants <3 months old. RSV-associated admissions peaked in infants aged 6 weeks, and those born September to November. Conclusions: We employed novel methodology using linked datasets to produce detailed estimates of RSV-associated admissions in infants.

388,"A model of the costs of community and nosocomial pediatric respiratory syncytial virus infections in Canadian hospitals Background: Approximately one in 10 hospitalized patients will acquire a nosocomial infection (NI) after admission to hospital, of which 71% are due to respiratory viruses, including the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). NIs are concerning and lead to prolonged hospitalizations. The economics of NIs are typically described in generalized terms and specific cost data are lacking. objective: To develop an evidence-based model for predicting the risk and cost of nosocomial RSV infection in pediatric settings. Methods: A model was developed, from a Canadian perspective, to capture all costs related to an RSV infection hospitalization, including the risk and cost of an NI, diagnostic testing and infection control. All data inputs were derived from published literature. Deterministic sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the uncertainty associated with the estimates and to explore the impact of changes to key variables. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to estimate a confidence interval for the overall cost estimate. Results: The estimated cost of nosocomial RSV infection adds approximately 30.5% to the hospitalization costs for the treatment of community-acquired severe RSV infection. The net benefits of the prevention activities were estimated to be equivalent to 9% of the total RSV-related costs. Changes in the estimated hospital infection transmission rates did not have a significant impact on the base-case estimate. Conclusions: The risk and cost of nosocomial RSV infection contributes to the overall burden of RSV. The present model, which was developed to estimate this burden, can be adapted to other countries with different disease epidemiology, costs and hospital infection transmission rates. 2013 Pulsus Group Inc.

390,"Antigenic Fingerprinting of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)-A-Infected Hematopoietic Cell Transplant Recipients Reveals Importance of Mucosal Anti-RSV G Antibodies in Control of RSV Infection in Humans Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection causes significant morbidity in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. However, antibody responses that correlate with recovery from RSV disease are not fully understood. Methods: In this study, antibody repertoire in paired serum and nasal wash samples from acutely RSV-A-infected HCT recipients who recovered early (<14 days of RSV shedding) were compared with late-recovered patients (14 days of shedding) using gene fragment phage display libraries and surface plasmon resonance. Results: Anti-F serum responses were similar between these 2 groups for antibody repertoires, neutralization titers, anti-F binding antibodies (prefusion and postfusion proteins), antibody avidity, and binding to specific antigenic sites. In contrast, nasal washes from early-recovered individuals demonstrated higher binding to F peptide containing p27. While the serum RSV G antibody repertoires in the 2 groups were similar, the strongest difference between early-recovered and late-recovered patients was observed in the titers of nasal wash antibodies, especially binding to the central conserved domain. Most importantly, a significantly higher antibody affinity to RSV G was observed in nasal washes from early-recovered individuals compared with late-recovered HCT recipients. Conclusions: These findings highlight the importance of mucosal antibodies in resolution of RSV-A infection in the upper respiratory tract.

391,"Review of the home care programmes for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) prophylaxis in Ireland and The Netherlands Severe infection of infants with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of morbidity in the developed world and mortality in the developing world. Prophylaxis using palivizumab in infants at risk for severe RSV disease reduces the rate of hospitalisation in this population of children. To ensure complete prophylaxis, infants must receive monthly doses over the winter season. To improve parental convenience, the Synacare() programme was implemented in Ireland and the Netherlands. Synacare() is now a longstanding programme in which palivizumab is administered in the home setting by skilled nurses. Protocols and procedures described here illustrate the efficiency and acceptability of the home delivery service of RSV disease prophylaxis. Post-administration surveys have indicated a high level of parental satisfaction with the programme. At-home paediatric programmes like Synacare() may serve as an alternative to burdensome monthly hospital visits and may lead to enhanced clinical outcomes.

392,"Direct medical costs of treating Mexican children under 2 years of age with respiratory syncytial virus Background. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most frequent etiologic agent causing lower respiratory tract infection in children <2 years of age. Between 0.5 and 3% of patients will require hospitalization. The aim of this study was to estimate the direct medical cost of treating children <2 years old with suspicion of RSV at the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS). Methods. Direct medical costs were estimated from an institutional perspective. Medical records were reviewed from patients <2 years of age who attended emergency services in second-level hospitals including subjects who required hospitalization. Estimated costs were obtained with the microcosting technique using the institutional costs from IMSS (year 2010). Costs were reported in USD (year 2011). Results. When analyzing total medical costs, outpatient management yielded a cost of $230.0  $10.30 U.S. dollars (USD), whereas hospitalized patients exhibited an average cost of $8,313.20  $595.30 USD. The main components of outpatient management costs were emergency visits, specialist consultations and diagnostic testing (41.6%, 32.7% and 10.7% of the total cost, respectively). In the case of hospitalized patients, intensive care unit cost (89.3%) and overall hospitalization cost (6.5%) represented 95.7% of the total cost. Conclusions. RSV is a disease that represents a significant economic burden for health care institutions, although most patients are treated on an outpatient basis. (Mould-Quevedo J.F.)

393,"Epidemiology and risk factors for severe respiratory syncytial virus infections requiring pediatric intensive care admission in Hong Kong children Purpose: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common cause of lower respiratory tract infection in young children. However, there are limited data on severe RSV infection requiring pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission. This retrospective study described features of RSV-associated PICU admissions in Hong Kong and investigated factors for mortality and duration of PICU stay. Methods: Children with laboratory-confirmed RSV infection and admitted to the PICUs of all eight government hospitals in Hong Kong between January 2009 and June 2011 were identified from computerized auditing systems and PICU databases. RSV in respiratory samples was detected by direct immunofluorescence and/or viral culture. The relationships between mortality and PICU duration and demographic and clinical factors were analyzed. Results: A total of 118 (2.4 %) PICU admissions were identified among 4,912 RSV-positive pediatric cases in all hospitals. Sixty-five (55.6 %) patients were infants. PICU admissions were higher between October and March. Eight (6.8 %) patients died, but only two were infants. RSV-associated mortality was related to prior sick contact, presence of older siblings, neurodevelopmental conditions, chromosomal and genetic diseases, and bacterial co-infections, but none was significant following logistic regression analyses (odds ratio 9.36, 95 % confidence interval 0.91-96.03 for prior sick contact, p = 0.060). Chronic lung disease was the only risk factor for the duration of PICU admission ( = 0.218, p = 0.017). Conclusions: The majority of RSV-infected children do not require PICU support. There is winter seasonality for RSV-associated PICU admission in Hong Kong. Prior sick contact is the only risk factor for RSV-associated mortality, whereas the presence of chronic lung disease is associated with longer PICU stay. The current risk-based approach of RSV prophylaxis may not be effective in reducing severe RSV infections.  2013 Springer-Verlag. (Leung T.F., tfleung@cuhk.edu.hk; Hon K.L.)

394,"Influenza- and respiratory syncytial virus-associated adult mortality in Soweto Background. Influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections cause seasonal excess mortality and hospitalisation in adults (particularly the elderly) in high-income countries. Little information exists on the impact of these infections on adults in Africa. Objectives. To estimate influenza- and RSV-related adult mortality, stratified by age and hospitalisation in Soweto. Study design. A retrospective hospital-based study in Soweto from 1997 to 1999 to estimate influenza- and RSV-related excess all-cause deaths and hospitalisation using a rate-difference method. The study was based on influenza seasons of varying severity, provided by surveillance data. Results. Influenza seasons were significantly associated with excess mortality in adults across all 3 years, except for 18 - 64-year-olds in 1998. Excess mortality was highest in those 65 years of age: 82.8/100 000 population in the mild 1997 season and 220.9/100 000 in the severe 1998 season. Influenza significantly increased adult medical hospitalisation in the severe 1998 season alone. RSV did not significantly affect mortality or hospitalisation. Conclusion. Influenza-related mortality was substantial and disproportionately affected the elderly. Influenza vaccination for the elderly warrants consideration. The RSV-related burden was not significantly increased but merits observation over a longer period. (Karstaedt A.S., karstaedt@mweb.co.za; Hopley M.; Wong M.)

395,"The increasing age of respiratory syncytial virus-related hospitalisation during COVID-19 pandemic in Lyon was associated with reduced hospitalisation costs Background: Preventive measures applied during the COVID-19 pandemic have modified the age distribution, the clinical severity and the incidence of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) hospitalisations during the 2020/21 RSV season. The aim of the present study was to estimate the impact of these aspects on RSV-associated hospitalisations (RSVH) costs stratified by age group between pre-COVID-19 seasons and 2020/21 RSV season. Methods: We compared the incidence, the median costs, and total RSVH costs from the national health insurance perspective in children < 24 months of age during the COVID-19 period (2020/21 RSV season) with a pre-COVID-19 period (2014/17 RSV seasons). Children were born and hospitalised in the Lyon metropolitan area. RSVH costs were extracted from the French medical information system (Programme de Medicalisation des Systemes d'Information). Results: The RSVH-incidence rate per 1000 infants aged < 3 months decreased significantly from 4.6 (95 % CI [4.1; 5.2]) to 3.1 (95 % CI [2.4; 4.0]), and increased in older infants and children up to 24 months of age during the 2020/21 RSV season. Overall, RSVH costs for RSVH cases aged below 2 years old decreased by 201,770 (31 %) during 2020/21 RSV season compared to the mean pre-COVID-19 costs. Conclusions: The sharp reduction in costs of RSVH in infants aged < 3 months outweighed the modest increase in costs observed in the 324 months age group. Therefore, conferring a temporal protection through passive immunisation to infants aged < 3 months should have a major impact on RSVH costs even if it results in an increase of RSVH in older children infected later in life. Nevertheless, stakeholders should be aware of this potential increase of RSVH in older age groups presenting with a wider range of disease to avoid any bias in estimating the cost-effectiveness of passive immunisation strategies.

396,"Cochrane in context: Monoclonal antibody for reducing the risk of respiratory syncytial virus infection in children Background Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the most important viral pathogens causing acute respiratory infections, resulting in about 3.4 million hospitalizations annually in children younger than 5 years. Palivizumab is the only product approved for the prevention of critical RSV infection, as motavizumab is no longer being developed for this condition. The efficacy and safety of palivizumab has been evaluated in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and a large number of economic evaluations (EEs) have tested its cost-effectiveness. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of palivizumab prophylaxis in reducing the risk of complications (hospitalization owing to RSV infection) in high-risk infants and children. To assess the cost-effectiveness (or cost-utility) of palivizumab prophylaxis in infants and children in different risk groups. Search methods We searched CENTRAL (2012, Issue 7), MEDLINE (1996 to July week 4, 2012), EMBASE (1996 to August 2012), CINAHL (1996 to August 2012) and LILACS (1996 to August 2012) for RCTs. We searched the NHS Economic Evaluations Database (NHS EED 2012, Issue 4), Health Economics Evaluations Database (HEED, 9 August 2012), Paediatric Economic Database Evaluations (PEDE, 1980 to 2009), MEDLINE (1996 to July week 4, 2012) and EMBASE (1996 to August 2012) for EEs. Selection criteria We included RCTs comparing palivizumab prophylaxis with a placebo or another type of prophylaxis in preventing critical lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV in paediatric patients at high risk. We included cost-effectiveness analyses and cost-utility analyses comparing palivizumab prophylaxis with no prophylaxis. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias for the included studies and extracted data for both the RCTs and EEs. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and their associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes and for adverse events. For continuous outcomes, we provided a narrative summary of results following missing data on standard deviations.We performed fixed-effect meta-analyses for the estimation of pooled effects whenever there was no indication of heterogeneity between included RCTs. We summarized the results reported in included EEs, such as incremental costs, incremental effectiveness and incremental cost-effectiveness and/or costutility ratios, and we calculated the present values of the ratios in 2011 Euros for all studies. Main results Of the seven available RCTs, three compared palivizumab with a placebo in a total of 2831 patients, and four compared palivizumab with motavizumab in a total of 8265 patients. All RCTs were sponsored by the drug manufacturing company. The overall quality of RCTs was good, but most of the outcomes assessed relied on data from only two studies. Palivizumab prophylaxis was associated with a statistically significant reduction in RSV hospitalizations (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.37-0.64) and a statistically nonsignificant reduction in all-cause mortality (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.42-1.15) when compared with placebo. When compared with motavizumab, palivizumab recipients showed a nonsignificant increase in the risk of RSV hospitalizations (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.97-1.90) and a nonsignificant risk reduction in all-cause mortality (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.43). In both cases, the proportion of children with any adverse event or any adverse event related to the study drug was similar between the two groups. We included 34 studies that reported costeffectiveness and/or cost-utility data for palivizumab prophylaxis in high-risk children with different underlying medical conditions. The overall quality of EEs was good, but the variations in modelling approaches were considerable across the studies, leading to large differences in the results. The cost-effectiveness of palivizumab prophylaxis depends on the consumption of resources taken into account by the study authors, and on the cost-effectiveness threshold set by the healthcare sector in each country.  2013 The Cochrane Collaboration.

397,"Time and out-of-pocket costs associated with respiratory syncytial virus hospitalization of infants Objective: The objective of this study was to quantify time spent plus out-of-pocket costs associated with confirmed respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) hospitalization of infants not prophylaxed against RSV. Methods: A prospective survey was carried out at multiple tertiary care hospitals in the United States. Patients: The patients consisted of a consecutive sample of infants <12 months, born between 33 and 35 weeks of gestation. One site also enrolled full-term infants hospitalized with confirmed RSV. Daily patient census identified eligible patients. Consenting caregivers of eligible subjects (n = 84, 1 refusal) were interviewed on discharge day and by telephone 30 days following discharge regarding time and out-of-pocket costs due to RSV. Results: Total average out of pocket expenses were $643.69 (range $21-$16,867; SD $2,403) for premature and $214.42 (range $6-$827; SD $218) (P = .0158) for full-term subjects. Total average economic burden per admission was $4517.07 for premature and $2135.30 for full-term infants, including the value of lost productivity but excluding inpatient hospital and physician bills and lost income. Premature infants (n = 48) had longer hospital stays (mean 6.9 days; SD 7.5 vs. 3.4 days; SD 2.6 days) (P = .001) with an associated mean total time spent by up to 5 adults of 281.7 hours (range 25-2819.7 hours; SD 465.8 hours) versus a mean of 139.7 hours (range 31.8-561.3 hours; SD 118.1 hours) for term infants (P = .109). Time and out-of-pocket costs continued after discharge. Conclusions: RSV hospitalization of infants is associated with substantial, previously unmeasured time and monetary losses. These losses continued following discharge. The economic burden on families and society appears heavier for infants born at 33 to 35 weeks of gestation than for full-term infants.

398,"The Effect of Early Knowledge of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Positivity on Medical Decision Making and Throughput Time within the Pediatric Emergency Department Objective The aim of this study was to evaluate whether early knowledge of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) positivity by rapid triage-based testing protocol improved emergency department (ED) throughput time and decreased ED ancillary testing and antibiotic administration. Methods A retrospective cohort study was performed of ED patients aged 2 to 12 months, presenting November 1 to March 31 for the years 2008-2013. Included patients presented with fever and upper respiratory tract symptoms. Patients were excluded if they tested positive for influenza, had chronic underlying medical problems, or were admitted or transferred from an outside facility or if no RSV result was documented. The study group was compared with infants who tested negative for RSV by the triage-based protocol and were diagnosed as having (1) bronchiolitis and (2) a viral illness. Results Of 899 patients tested for RSV within triage, the study included 713 (79%); 231 (35.3%) tested positive for RSV. When comparing children diagnosed as having bronchiolitis, there was no statistically significant difference between RSV positive and negative in ED throughput time, ED administered antibiotics, or chest radiographs, urine analyses, blood cultures, or lumbar punctures obtained. When comparing children diagnosed as having a viral illness, RSV-positive patients had less chest radiographs, urine analysis, and blood cultures performed. Conclusions Identifying the virus responsible for bronchiolitis through a triage-based protocol does not decrease ED throughput time, antibiotic administration, or chest radiographs, urine analysis, or blood cultures obtained. In infants presenting with upper respiratory tract symptoms and fever, knowing RSV infectivity through a triage-based protocol does significantly decrease chest radiographs, urine analysis, and blood cultures obtained.

399,"Modelling the household-level impact of a maternal respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine in a high-income setting Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infects almost all children by the age of 2 years, with the risk of hospitalisation highest in the first 6 months of life. Development and licensure of a vaccine to prevent severe RSV illness in infants is a public health priority. A recent phase 3 clinical trial estimated the efficacy of maternal vaccination at 39% over the first 90 days of life. Households play a key role in RSV transmission; however, few estimates of population-level RSV vaccine impact account for household structure. Methods: We simulated RSV transmission within a stochastic, individual-based model framework, using an existing demographic model, structured by age and household and parameterised with Australian data, as an exemplar of a high-income country. We modelled vaccination by immunising pregnant women and explicitly linked the immune status of each mother-infant pair. We quantified the impact on children for a range of vaccine properties and uptake levels. Results: We found that a maternal immunisation strategy would have the most substantial impact in infants younger than 3 months, reducing RSV infection incidence in this age group by 16.6% at 70% vaccination coverage. In children aged 36 months, RSV infection was reduced by 5.3%. Over the first 6 months of life, the incidence rate for infants born to unvaccinated mothers was 1.26 times that of infants born to vaccinated mothers. The impact in older age groups was more modest, with evidence of infections being delayed to the second year of life. Conclusions: Our findings show that while individual benefit from maternal RSV vaccination could be substantial, population-level reductions may be more modest. Vaccination impact was sensitive to the extent that vaccination prevented infection, highlighting the need for more vaccine trial data.

400,"Morbidity profiles of patients consulting during influenza and respiratory syncytial virus active periods We compared the burden of illness due to a spectrum of respiratory diagnostic categories among persons presenting in a sentinel general practice network in England and Wales during periods of influenza and of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) activity. During all periods of viral activity, incidence rates of influenza-like illness, bronchitis and common cold were elevated compared to those in baseline periods. Excess rates per 100 000 of acute bronchitis were greater in children aged <1 year (median difference 2702, 95% CI 929-4867) and in children aged 1-4 years (994, 95% CI 338-1747) during RSV active periods rather than influenza; estimates for the two viruses were similar in other age groups. Excess rates of influenza-like illness in all age groups were clearly associated with influenza virus activity. For common cold the estimates of median excess rates were significantly higher in RSV active periods for the age groups <1 year (3728, 95% CI 632-5867) and 5-14 years (339, 95% CI 59-768); estimates were similar in other age groups for the two viruses.

401,"The absence of enhanced disease with wild type respiratory syncytial virus infection occurring after receipt of live, attenuated, respiratory syncytial virus vaccines Early in the development of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines severe disease occurred in children after receipt of formalin-inactivated RSV vaccine. Continuing efforts to develop an appropriately attenuated and immunogenic live RSV vaccine have given opportunities to assure that live vaccines are safe through surveillance of children after vaccination. In the present study, the rate of RSV-associated upper respiratory tract illness in 388 children was lower in RSV vaccinated children than in controls (14% versus 20% in a 6-24 month old group and 16% versus 25% in infants). Additionally, there was no evidence that vaccination predisposed to more severe lower respiratory tract illness. Thus infection with a series of live attenuated RSV vaccines did not result in enhanced disease upon infection with wild type RSV. The impact of RSV during this surveillance will inform the design of future efficacy studies with RSV vaccines.  2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

402,"A 4-year survey on palivizumab respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-prophylaxis: How can compliance be improved? Objective. To identify compliance-influencing factors and to suggest strategies for overcoming barriers in a preventive medicine program. Methods. A survey was conducted to evaluate compliance in children receiving palivizumab prophylaxis for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections. Demographics, neonatal variables, and parental attitudes capable of influencing the outcome of prophylaxis were studied in 216 children over a four-year period. Results. The overall compliance rate with all recommended doses of palivizumab was 87%. Among the neonatal characteristics, low birth weight and a younger age at the beginning of the program were significantly associated with good compliance (p < 0.05). The strongest factor influencing poor compliance was being foreign-born or a non-native speaker (p < 0.01). Conclusions. Compliance to RSV infection prophylaxis is reduced in infants born to foreign-born or non-native speakers.

403,"A practical guide for the prevention of respiratory syncytial (RSV) disease in high-risk infants in Saudi Arabia. Saudi Task Force Committee for RSV Prophylaxis Many studies worldwide have shown that approximately 50% of children are infected with respiratory syncytial virus by the first year of age, with the peak rate occurring in infants aged 6 weeks to 6 months. RSV is estimated to cause up to 90% of all childhood bronchiolitis and up to 40% of all childhood pneumonias, often requiring hospitalization. Approximately 40% of those hospitalized with RSV have an underlying condition such as prematurity or lung or heart disease. Evidence from epidemiological data demonstrates a link between early RSV infection and chronic respiratory morbidity persisting into adolescence and young adulthood, especially for preterm infants. Local Saudi data have shown that RSV is the most common respiratory virus in children under 5 years of age hospitalized for respiratory illness. Palivizumab (Synagis; Abbott/Medlmmune), a humanized monoclonal antibody produced by recombinant DNA technology, has been approved as a prophylaxis for RSV and has been shown to reduce hospitalizations for RSV and the incidence of longer-term sequelae. The guidelines suggested here seek to balance the risk of RSV infection with currently available resources, and are a modification of the 1998 American Academy of Pediatrics' guidelines. They offer evidence-based and cost-effective recommendations to assist neonatologists, pulmonologists and paediatricians to use palivizumab (Synagis) as an immuno-prophylaxis for RSV infection in selected high-risk infants and children. These infants include those born at 28 weeks' gestation or less without evidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), if less than 2 years' corrected age at the RSV season; infants discharged home on oxygen for BPD regardless of gestational age, if less than 2 years' corrected age at the RSV season; and infants born at 29 to 32 weeks of gestation if diagnosed with BPD but not discharged home on oxygen, and less than 1 year of corrected age at the onset of the RSV season. Specific recommendations are also made for vaccination with palivizumab (Synagis) for infants and children with congenital heart disease who meet certain criteria for age and severity, including those who with haemodynamically significant congenital heart disease, those under medication for cardiomyopathy and those who are to undergo cardiac catheterization at the onset of the RSV season. Certain categories should receive continuing RSV prophylaxis from 1 to 2 years of age. In children with heart disease who are not generally considered to be in at-risk groups, the paediatric cardiologist should individually assess the appropriateness of RSV prophylaxis for certain categories, including children with haemodynamically insignificant heart disease, corrected congenital heart disease, or mild cardiomyopathies not requiring medication. The Saudi Task Force Committee for RSV Prophylaxis recommends these guidelines as a broad guide to the introduction and use of prophylactic agents against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), subject to future change as necessary.

404,"Forward and reverse translational approaches to predict efficacy of neutralizing respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) antibody prophylaxis Background: Neutralizing mAbs can prevent communicable viral diseases. MK-1654 is a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) F glycoprotein neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) under development to prevent RSV infection in infants. Development and validation of methods to predict efficacious doses of neutralizing antibodies across patient populations exposed to a time-varying force of infection (i.e., seasonal variation) are necessary. Methods: Five decades of clinical trial literature were leveraged to build a model-based meta-analysis (MBMA) describing the relationship between RSV serum neutralizing activity (SNA) and clinical endpoints. The MBMA was validated by backward translation to animal challenge experiments and forward translation to predict results of a recent RSV mAb trial. MBMA predictions were evaluated against a human trial of 70 participants who received either placebo or one of four dose-levels of MK-1654 and were challenged with RSV [NCT04086472]. The MBMA was used to perform clinical trial simulations and predict efficacy of MK-1654 in the infant target population. Findings: The MBMA established a quantitative relationship between RSV SNA and clinical endpoints. This relationship was quantitatively consistent with animal model challenge experiments and results of a recently published clinical trial. Additionally, SNA elicited by increasing doses of MK-1654 in humans reduced RSV symptomatic infection rates with a quantitative relationship that approximated the MBMA. The MBMA indicated a high probability that a single dose of  75 mg of MK-1654 will result in prophylactic efficacy (> 75% for 5 months) in infants. Interpretation: An MBMA approach can predict efficacy of neutralizing antibodies against RSV and potentially other respiratory pathogens.

This study investigated the genetic variability of the attachment (G) protein gene among RSV strains prevalent in southwestern China.

A total of 1,387 NPA specimens were collected from April 2006 to March 2009, and 439 (31.7%) were positive for RSV. During the study period, subgroup A and B viruses accounted for 79.5% (349/439) and 19.8% (87/439) of the total positive samples, respectively. Both subgroup A and B viruses were identified in three samples. Subgroup A viruses were predominant during two epidemic seasons (2006 to 2008), while subgroup B strains prevailed during the 2008-2009 epidemic season. Phylogenetic analyses showed that all 30 group A strains could be clustered into one genotype, genotype GA2, and 30 group B strains could be clustered into three genotypes, genotypes GBl, GB3, and BA, among which 17 genotype BA strains were detected from 23 group B strains selected during the 2008-2009 epidemic season. The G gene of genotype BA was predicted to encode proteins of five different lengths. These data suggest that group A RSV likely predominated in southwestern China and that a new genotype of subgroup B with a 60-nucleotide insertion, named BA-like virus, became the dominant genotype in the 2008-2009 epidemic season.

406,"Winter viruses: Influenza- and respiratory syncytial virus-related morbidity in chronic lung disease Background: Chronic lung disease predisposes to serious consequences of respiratory viruses. While increasing influenza immunization rates in older adults signals an awareness of the impact of influenza, children with asthma are infrequently immunized. While respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is recognized as an important target of vaccine development for infants, its impact on adults is underappreciated. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study to estimate rates of hospitalizations, deaths, outpatient visits, and antibiotic courses due to influenza and RSV in persons with chronic lung disease in the Tennessee Medicaid program from 1995 to 1999. Differences between study event rates when influenza was cocirculating with RSV and event rates when RSV was circulating alone were used to calculate influenza-attributable morbidity. Differences in rates when RSV was circulating alone and during summer months were calculated to assess the effect of RSV. Results: Influenza- and RSV-associated hospitalizations were highest at the extremes of age. There were an estimated 8 and 23 hospitalizations per 1000 children younger than 5 years annually due to influenza and RSV, respectively. There were 23 and 18 hospitalizations, as well as 2 and 5 deaths per 1000 persons 65 years or older annually due to influenza and RSV, respectively. Both viruses were associated with an excess of outpatient visits in children, and antibiotic prescriptions in all age groups. Conclusion: Among persons with chronic lung disease, influenza virus and RSV accounted for 15% to 33% of acute respiratory hospitalizations in children, 7% to 9% of such hospitalizations in adults, and 9% of deaths in those 65 years or older.

407,"Impact of Respiratory Syncytial Virus on Child, Caregiver, and Family Quality of Life in the United States: Systematic Literature Review and Analysis Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection in US children, reduces quality of life (QOL) of children, their caregivers, and families. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review in PubMed, EconLit, and other databases in the United States of articles published since 2000, derived utility lost per RSV episode from cohort studies, and performed a systematic analysis. Results: From 2262 unique citations, 35 received full-text review and 7 met the inclusion criteria (2 cohort studies, 4 modeling studies, and 1 synthesis). Pooled data from the 2 cohort studies (both containing only hospitalized premature infants) gave quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) losses per episode of 0.0173 at day 38. From the cohort study that also assessed caregivers' QOL, we calculated net QALYs lost directly attributable to RSV per nonfatal episode from onset to 60 days after onset for the child, caregiver, child-and-caregiver dyad of 0.0169 (167% over prematurity alone), 0.0031, and 0.0200, respectively. Conclusion: Published data on QOL of children in the United States with RSV are scarce and consider only premature hospitalized infants, whereas most RSV episodes occur in children who were born at term and were otherwise healthy. QOL studies are needed beyond hospitalized premature infants.

408,"Effectiveness of drug therapies to treat or prevent respiratory syncytial virus infection-related morbidity Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection causes a huge burden to the health service, as it results in a large number of in-patient days each year and increases the risk of asthma in childhood. In the acute phase, therapy is supportive as bronchodilators and corticosteroids have resulted, at best, only in short-term benefits; promising treatments for ventilated patients, such as exogenous surfactant, require further testing. Passive immunoprophylaxis reduces hospital admission in high risk groups. In the prevention of chronic respiratory morbidity following RSV infection, however, studies are needed to determine whether immunoprophylaxis will have a useful role and to identify which drug treatment will be most cost-effective.

409,"Effects of parental and household smoking on the risk of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) hospitalisation in late-preterm infants and the potential impact of RSV prophylaxis Objective: To assess the impact of household smoking and palivizumab prophylaxis on the risk of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) hospitalisation in late-preterm (32-35 weeks' gestational age) infants. Methods: Familial smoking and other RSV risk factor data from the FLIP, FLIP-2 and IMpact studies and datasets from France, Germany and Italy, together with palivizumab prophylaxis data from the FLIP-2 and IMpact studies, were analysed using cross-correlation and Bayesian meta-analytical modelling employing Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling. Results: There were 2.35 times (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.37-4.02) as many hospitalisations amongst infants from smoking compared with those from non-smoking families. Among non-prophylaxed infants, there were 2.53 times (95% CI 1.27-4.94) as many RSV hospitalisations from smoking than from non-smoking families and that excess hospitalisation was reduced to 1.03 times (95% CI 0.38-2.99) amongst prophylaxed infants. Familial smoking correlates significantly (p<0.01) with other RSV risk factors: positive correlation with number of school-age siblings, history of family atopy, family wheeze and gestational age; negative correlation with birth weight and breast feeding. Conclusions: Late-preterm infants from smoking families appear to be at heightened risk for severe RSV infection requiring hospitalisation of which the risk may be reduced with RSV prophylaxis.  2013 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved.

410,"Natural history and epidemiology of respiratory syncytial virus infection in the Middle East: Hospital surveillance for children under age two in Jordan Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of bronchiolitis and viral pneumonia in infants and young children worldwide. In the Middle East and Arab countries, the burden of RSV-associated hospitalizations is not well characterized. We sought to determine the burden and clinical/epidemiological characteristics of RSV hospitalization in young children in Amman, Jordan. We investigated risk factors for severity including vitamin D levels. Methods: We conducted viral surveillance with clinical and demographic data in children <2 years admitted with respiratory symptoms and/or fever at the Al-Bashir Government Hospital from March16, 2010 to March 31, 2013. Nasal/throat swabs were obtained and placed into lysis buffer, and frozen at -80. C until testing by real-time RT-PCR for 11 respiratory viruses. Heel stick blood or sera samples for 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels were obtained and sent to a central laboratory for mass spectrometry. Results: Of the 3168 children, >80% testing positive for one virus, with RSV the most common virus detected (44%). The RSV-associated hospitalization rate was highest in children <6 months with an annual range of 21.1-25.9 per 1000, compared to 6.0-8.0 in 6-11-month-olds and 1.6-2.5 in 12-23-month-olds. RSV-positive children compared with RSV-negative were more likely to be previously healthy without underlying medical conditions, less likely to be born prematurely, had a higher frequency of supplemental oxygen use, and had lower median vitamin D levels. Risk factors for oxygen use in RSV-positive children included underlying medical conditions, lack of breastfeeding, younger age, and higher viral load. Conclusion: RSV is a major cause of illness in hospitalized Jordanian children and is associated with increased severity compared to other respiratory viruses. Children with RSV in the Middle East would benefit from future RSV vaccines and antiviral therapy.

411,"Cost of hospitalization associated with respiratory syncytial virus infection versus influenza infection in hospitalized older adults Despite the severity of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease in older adults, data on its costs are limited. We compared hospitalization costs for 2090 adults aged  60 years hospitalized with RSV or influenza by assigning direct health care costs. Hospitalization with RSV was associated with longer hospitalization and increased frequency of diagnosis-related groups for pulmonary complications, resulting in costs at least as great as those for influenza ($16 034 vs $15 163; 95% confidence interval for the difference, $811 to $2547).

413,"Evaluation of a standardised protocol to measure the disease burden of respiratory syncytial virus infection in young children in primary care Background: A better understanding of the burden of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections in primary care is needed for policymakers to make informed decisions regarding new preventive measures and treatments. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a protocol for the standardised measurement of the disease burden of RSV infection in primary care in children aged < 5 years. Methods: The standardised protocol was evaluated in Italy and the Netherlands during the 2019/20 winter. Children aged < 5 years who consulted their primary care physician, met the WHO acute respiratory infections (ARI) case definition, and had a laboratory confirmed positive test for RSV (RT-PCR) were included. RSV symptoms were collected at the time of swabbing. Health care use, duration of symptoms and socio-economic impact was measured 14 days after swabbing. Health related Quality of life (HRQoL) was measured using the parent-proxy report of the PedsQLTM4.0 generic core scales (24 years) and PedsQLTM4.0 infant scales (02 years) 30 days after swabbing. The standardised protocol was evaluated in terms of the feasibility of patient recruitment, data collection procedures and whether parents understood the questions. Results: Children were recruited via a network of paediatricians in Italy and a sentinel influenza surveillance network of general practitioners in the Netherlands. In Italy and the Netherlands, 293 and 152 children were swabbed respectively, 119 and 32 tested RSV positive; for 119 and 12 children the Day-14 questionnaire was completed and for 116 and 11 the Day-30 questionnaire. In Italy, 33% of the children had persistent symptoms after 14 days and in the Netherlands this figure was 67%. Parents had no problems completing questions concerning health care use, duration of symptoms and socio-economic impact, however, they had some difficulties scoring the HRQoL of their young children. Conclusion: RSV symptoms are common after 14 days, and therefore, measuring disease burden outcomes like health care use, duration of symptoms, and socio-economic impact is also recommended at Day-30. The standardised protocol is suitable to measure the clinical and socio-economic disease burden of RSV in young children in primary care.

414,"Hospitalisation, morbidity and outcomes associated with respiratory syncytial virus compared with influenza in adults of all ages Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is understood to be a cause of significant disease in older adults and children. Further analysis of RSV in younger adults may reveal further insight into its role as an important pathogen in all age groups. Methods: We identified, through laboratory data, adults who tested positive for either influenza or RSV between January 2017 and June 2019 at a single Australian hospital. We compared baseline demographics, testing patterns, hospitalisations and outcomes between these groups. Results: Of 1128 influenza and 193 RSV patients, the RSV cohort was older (mean age 54.7 vs. 64.9, p < 0.001) and was more comorbid as determined by the Charlson Comorbidity Index (2.4 vs. 3.2, p < 0.001). For influenza hospitalisations, the majority admitted were aged under 65 which was not the case for RSV (61.8% vs. 45.6%, p < 0.001). Testing occurred later in RSV hospitalisations as measured by the proportion tested in the emergency department (ED) (80.3% vs. 69.2%, p < 0.001), and this was strongly associated with differences in presenting phenotype (the presence of fever). RSV was the biggest predictor of 6-month representation, with age and comorbidities predicting this less strongly. Conclusion: RSV is a significant contributor to morbidity and hospitalisation, sometimes outweighing that of influenza, and is not limited to elderly cohorts. Understanding key differences in the clinical syndrome and consequent testing paradigms may allow better detection and potentially treatment of RSV to reduce individual morbidity and health system burden. This growing area of research helps quantify the need for directed therapies for RSV. (Leaver B.A., bleaver@live.com.au; Irving L.)

In May 2023, two RSV vaccines were approved for prevention of RSV lower respiratory tract disease in adults aged 60 years. In June 2023, CDC recommended RSV vaccination for adults aged 60 years, using shared clinical decision-making. Using data from the Respiratory Syncytial Virus-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network, a population-based hospitalization surveillance system operating in 12 states, this analysis examined characteristics (including age, underlying medical conditions, and clinical outcomes) of 3,218 adults aged 60 years who were hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed RSV infection during July 2022-June 2023. Among a random sample of 1,634 older adult patients with RSV-associated hospitalization, 54.1% were aged 75 years, and the most common underlying medical conditions were obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, and diabetes. Severe outcomes occurred in 18.5% (95% CI = 15.9%-21.2%) of hospitalized patients aged 60 years. Overall, 17.0% (95% CI = 14.5%-19.7%) of patients with RSV infection were admitted to an intensive care unit, 4.8% (95% CI = 3.5%-6.3%) required mechanical ventilation, and 4.7% (95% CI = 3.6%-6.1%) died; 17.2% (95% CI = 14.9%-19.8%) of all cases occurred in long-term care facility residents. These data highlight the importance of prioritizing those at highest risk for severe RSV disease and suggest that clinicians and patients consider age (particularly age 75 years), long-term care facility residence, and underlying medical conditions, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and congestive heart failure, in shared clinical decision-making when offering RSV vaccine to adults aged 60 years.

417,"Latitudinal Variations in Seasonal Activity of Influenza and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV): A Global Comparative Review Background: There is limited information on influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) seasonal patterns in tropical areas, although there is renewed interest in understanding the seasonal drivers of respiratory viruses. Methods: We review geographic variations in seasonality of laboratory-confirmed influenza and RSV epidemics in 137 global locations based on literature review and electronic sources. We assessed peak timing and epidemic duration and explored their association with geography and study settings. We fitted time series model to weekly national data available from the WHO influenza surveillance system (FluNet) to further characterize seasonal parameters. Results: Influenza and RSV activity consistently peaked during winter months in temperate locales, while there was greater diversity in the tropics. Several temperate locations experienced semi-annual influenza activity with peaks occurring in winter and summer. Semi-annual activity was relatively common in tropical areas of Southeast Asia for both viruses. Biennial cycles of RSV activity were identified in Northern Europe. Both viruses exhibited weak latitudinal gradients in the timing of epidemics by hemisphere, with peak timing occurring later in the calendar year with increasing latitude (P<0.03). Time series model applied to influenza data from 85 countries confirmed the presence of latitudinal gradients in timing, duration, seasonal amplitude, and between-year variability of epidemics. Overall, 80% of tropical locations experienced distinct RSV seasons lasting 6 months or less, while the percentage was 50% for influenza. Conclusion: Our review combining literature and electronic data sources suggests that a large fraction of tropical locations experience focused seasons of respiratory virus activity in individual years. Information on seasonal patterns remains limited in large undersampled regions, included Africa and Central America. Future studies should attempt to link the observed latitudinal gradients in seasonality of viral epidemics with climatic and population factors, and explore regional differences in disease transmission dynamics and attack rates.

418,"Genome-wide study of globally distributed respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) strains implicates diversification utilizing phylodynamics and mutational analysis Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common respiratory pathogen that causes mild cold-like symptoms and severe lower respiratory tract infections, causing hospitalizations in children, the elderly and immunocompromised individuals. Due to genetic variability, this virus causes life-threatening pneumonia and bronchiolitis in young infants. Thus, we examined 3600 whole genome sequences submitted to GISAID by 31 December 2022 to examine the genetic variability of RSV. While RSVA and RSVB coexist throughout RSV seasons, RSVA is more prevalent, fatal, and epidemic-prone in several countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and China. Additionally, the virus's attachment glycoprotein and fusion protein were highly mutated, with RSVA having higher Shannon entropy than RSVB. The genetic makeup of these viruses contributes significantly to their prevalence and epidemic potential. Several strain-specific SNPs co-occurred with specific haplotypes of RSVA and RSVB, followed by different haplotypes of the viruses. RSVA and RSVB have the highest linkage probability at loci T12844A/T3483C and G13959T/C2198T, respectively. The results indicate that specific haplotypes and SNPs may significantly affect their spread. Overall, this analysis presents a promising strategy for tracking the evolving epidemic situation and genetic variants of RSV, which could aid in developing effective control, prophylactic, and treatment strategies.

Although we understand that some of the morbidity associated with RSV in neonates is due to immunological maturation that favors immunosuppression over antiviral innate and/or adaptive immune responses, the rapid development of the immune system right after birth suggests that each age group (newborn, early infant, older infant, toddler, and older) may respond to the virus in different ways. In this study, we summarize the morbidity associated with infection in young children in the context of immunological maturation of monocytes/macrophages and the ramifications for poor innate control of viral pathogenesis. We also summarize key mechanisms that contribute to the diminished antiviral innate immune responses of these young children.

421,"Delayed Admissions to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit: Progression of Disease or Errors in Emergency Department Management Objectives Few studies have evaluated impact of emergency department (ED) management on delayed transfers to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Our study objectives were to describe patient characteristics of PICU transfers less than or equal to 12 hours of admission and determine the reason for transfer. Methods We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients transferred to PICU less than or equal to 12 hours of admission. We extracted patient demographics, emergency severity index category, ED, floor and PICU length of stay (LOS), and PICU ""significant"" interventions. Charts were reviewed independently by the study principal investigator and a PICU attending who classified transfers as secondary to progression of disease or error in ED management. Furthermore, errors were classified as diagnostic, management, or disposition errors. Results A total of 164 patients met inclusion criteria. Most were male (86/164, 52.4%), with emergency severity index category 2 (116/164, 70.7%) and respiratory diagnosis (98/164, 59.8%). Most transfers (136/164, 82.9%) resulted from progression of illness. No significant interventions were performed in 48.8% (80/164) of patients. Of 164 transfers, 28 (17.1%) resulted from ED error, and half of these were management errors. Compared with disease progression, the ED error group had a significantly shorter median floor LOS {3.45 [interquartile range (IQR): 2.15, 7.56] vs 6.58 (IQR: 3.70, 9.20); P = 0.005}, more PICU interventions [1.5 (IQR: 0, 4) vs 0 (IQR: 0, 2); P = 0.006], and longer PICU LOS [2.50 (IQR: 1.09, 4.25) vs 1.36 (IQR: 0.80, 2.50); P = 0.013]. Conclusions Most PICU transfers less than or equal to 12 hours after admission result from illness progression. Half of these do not require significant interventions. The PICU transfers after ED management error had significantly shorter floor LOS, longer PICU LOS, and more interventions. (Czolgosz T., thomasczolgosz@gmail.com; Kannikeswaran N.)

422,"Nosocomial transmission of respiratory syncytial virus in neonatal intensive care and intermediate care units: A prospective epidemiologic study To test the hypothesis that a considerable number of preterm infants acquire respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) within the hospital during the postnatal stay, a prospective epidemiologic survey was performed. Nasopharyngeal swabs were taken twice weekly for a period of 8 weeks from preterm infants, medical/nursing staff, and parents during the peak of RSV season 2007/2008 and tested for RSV by polymerase chain reaction. Of 1002 samples, only 4 tested positive (2 from a patient, 2 from staff).

423,"Outbreaks in the neonatal ICU: A review of the literature Purpose of review: Neonates in the neonatal ICU (NICU) are uniquely vulnerable to colonization and infection with pathogens such as multidrug resistant Gram-negative bacteria, which in turn are associated with increased infectionrelated morbidities and higher case-fatality rates. We reviewed the English, French, and German language literature published between 2015 and 2017, for reports of NICU outbreaks. Recent findings: A total of 39 outbreaks in NICUs were reported with Gram-negative bacteria (n=21; 54%) causing most, and extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing organisms being the most frequent resistance mechanism reported (n=5). Five viral outbreaks were reported (respiratory syncytial virus=3). A significant proportion of outbreaks (33%) did not identify a source. Whole genome sequencing was used more (n=6 reports). The most common described infection prevention and control interventions included staff and parent education on hand hygiene, patient isolation, additional contact precautions, including discontinuation of 'kangaroo care', and cohorting. Reporting and publication bias are likely common. Summary: NICUs must be vigilant in identifying outbreaks, conduct comprehensive investigations, and implement targeted infection prevention and control strategies. Molecular epidemiology capacities are an essential element in outbreak investigation. More studies are needed to determine the added value of active colonization screening and their impact on outbreak development. (Johnson J.)

424,"Olfactomedin 4 serves as a marker for disease severity in pediatric respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection Background: Respiratory viral infections follow an unpredictable clinical course in young children ranging from a common cold to respiratory failure. The transition from mild to severe disease occurs rapidly and is difficult to predict. The pathophysiology underlying disease severity has remained elusive. There is an urgent need to better understand the immune response in this disease to come up with biomarkers that may aid clinical decision making. Methods: In a prospective study, flow cytometric and genome-wide gene expression analyses were performed on blood samples of 26 children with a diagnosis of severe, moderate or mild Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infection. Differentially expressed genes were validated using Q-PCR in a second cohort of 80 children during three consecutive winter seasons. FACS analyses were also performed in the second cohort and on recovery samples of severe cases in the first cohort. Results: Severe RSV infection was associated with a transient but marked decrease in CD4+ T, CD8+ T, and NK cells in peripheral blood. Gene expression analyses in both cohorts identified Olfactomedin4 (OLFM4) as a fully discriminative marker between children with mild and severe RSV infection, giving a PAM cross-validation error of 0%. Patients with an OLFM4 gene expression level above -7.5 were 6 times more likely to develop severe disease, after correction for age at hospitalization and gestational age. Conclusion: By combining genome-wide expression profiling of blood cell subsets with clinically wellannotated samples, OLFM4 was identified as a biomarker for severity of pediatric RSV infection.

425,"Factors related to compliance with palivizumab prophylaxis for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection - data from Poland AIM: To evaluate compliance and health outcomes in children receiving palivizumab prophylaxis and to identify factors that could impact parental compliance with the recommended regimen of palivizumab immunoprophylaxis.MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective, multicentre, non-interventional study of children enrolled in the Polish National Programme for Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Immunoprophylaxis who received 1 dose of palivizumab during two consecutive RSV seasons (I: 2008-2009, II: 2009-2010). For each child qualified to receive palivizumab, the following data were collected: sociodemographic factors, clinical characteristics at enrolment, and in the course of palivizumab prophylaxis.RESULTS: One thousand twenty-one infants were enrolled into the Registry at 29 sites across Poland and received a total of 3,241 palivizumab injections (average: 3.2 doses per child). The incidence of adverse reactions was 3.33%; nervousness was the most frequently reported event (1.23%). Overall, 771 (75.5%) children received all of their expected injections, whereas 635 (62.2%) children received their injections within the appropriate interdose interval. Compliance was lower in male infants. None of the other demographic, social, or clinical factors seemed to impact compliance. Non-compliant children had a higher rate of hospitalisation due to respiratory illness (22% vs 9.9%, p<0.0001, and 18.4% vs 9.5%, p<0.0001, for compliance defined by the number of expected injections received and by the interdose interval, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: Palivizumab prophylaxis was conducted in accordance with recommendations and was well tolerated in at-risk infants. Non-compliance was higher among male infants and was related with a higher rate of hospitalisation due to respiratory illness.

426,"Prophylaxis for respiratory syncytial virus with respiratory syncytial virus-immunoglobulin intravenous among preterm infants of thirty-two weeks gestation and less: Reduction in incidence, severity of illness and cost Objective. To determine the impact of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) prophylaxis among preterm infants of 32 weeks gestation by comparing the severity of illness and cost of RSV-related care during the two winter seasons before (1994 to 1995, 1995 to 1996) with the two seasons after initiation of prophylaxis (1996 to 1997, 1997 to 1998). Methods. Preterm infants of 32 weeks gestation at risk for hospitalization with RSV infection were identified retrospectively from the infants hospitalized in our neonatal units. Infants were included if they (1) were born 6 months before or during four winter seasons (1994 to 1998), (2) were discharged from the neonatal unit and (3) had remained in the university outpatient clinic system during at least the first winter of life. Preterm infants of 32 weeks gestation hospitalized with RSV were identified from our RSV database (which includes cost of hospitalization, duration of hospital stay, pediatric intensive care unit stay and intubation). Infants receiving prophylaxis were identified prospectively. Results. The incidence of hospitalization with RSV was significantly lower among the cohort of infants born after initiation of prophylaxis: 8.7% (17 of 195) vs. 22% (35 of 159), P = 0.00049 by two tailed Fisher's exact test. Among the cohort of infants born after initiation of prophylaxis (n = 195), 100 infants received prophylaxis. The gestational and chronologic ages of the prophylaxis-treated infants were significantly lower than those of the non-prophylaxis-treated infants (n = 95). The prophylaxis- treated infants also were more likely to have bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Only 1 (1%) of the prophylaxis-treated infants required hospitalization for RSV. Comparison of the cohort of infants born before initiation of prophylaxis to the cohort born after initiation of prophylaxis (includes prophylaxis-treated and non-prophylaxis-treated infants) revealed a significant reduction in severity of illness and cost. The length of stay in the cohort born before initiation of prophylaxis was reduced 83.8%: 373.6 days per 100 infants at risk vs. 60.5 (P = 0.00055). The length of stay in the pediatric intensive care unit was reduced 92.7%: 218.2 days per 100 infants at risk vs. 15.9 (P = 0.00029). The duration of intubation was reduced 95.6%: 187.4 days per 100 infants at risk vs. 8.2 (P = 0.00024). The dollars spent for RSV-related care (hospitalizations and prophylaxis) per 100 infants at risk for RSV was reduced 65% in the cohort of infants born after prophylaxis: $670 590 per 100 infants at risk vs. $234 596 (P = 0.00056). This reduction remained significant (64.9%) if the cost of ribavirin (drug and administration fees) was excluded from the cost of hospitalization. Conclusions. These data reveal that RSV prophylaxis significantly reduced the incidence of RSV hospitalizations and severity of illness as well as the cost of RSV-related care among these infants.

427,"Burden of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Hospitalizations in Canada Objective. To examine the socioeconomic burden of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease for Canadian infants hospitalized for the condition. Data and Methods. The descriptive study used data collected in Alberta, Canada, during 2 consecutive RSV seasons. Infants (<1 year of age) were included if they had not received palivizumab and were hospitalized with a confirmed diagnosis of RSV. Hospitalization resource use and parental time burden, out-of-pocket costs, lost work productivity, and stress and anxiety were assessed. Results. 13.4% of all infants (n = 67) had intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and average ICU stay for these infants was 6.5 days. Families had average out-of-pocket expenses of 736.69 Canadian dollars (CAD $), and the average time both parents spent in hospital was nearly 7 days (164.0 hours). For working parents (n = 43), average absenteeism was 49% and overall work impairment was 77.8%. Parents also exhibited significant parental stress (3.6 on the Parental Stressor Scale: 43.9 state anxiety and 36.9 trait anxiety scores). Conclusions. Results indicate a high burden associated with the hospitalization of an infant due to RSV disease in terms of resource use, time, productivity, costs, and stress, even among a population of infants not considered to be at risk for the condition.

428,"Palivizumab in preventing respiratory syncytial virus-related hospitalization in high-risk infants Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes seasonal epidemics (winter or wet-season) of serious lower respiratory tract infections in young infants with subsequent increased frequency of recurrent wheezing during early childhood. Palivizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that provides immunoprophylaxis against RSV when administered monthly over the RSV season. It significantly reduced hospitalizations in high-risk infants including preterm infants with and without bronchopulmonary dysplasia and infants with hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease. Since its license in 1998, approximately 36 methodologically different economic studies have been performed to prove cost-effectiveness of the product. The majority of cost-effectiveness analyses revealed costs of palivizumab exceeding anticipated savings from reduced RSV hospitalizations. A minority of studies performed cost-effectiveness analyses using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios as costs per quality-adjusted life-year gained. The wide variability in the results of economic studies with estimates ranging from cost savings to incremental costs of a high order of magnitude with its use is discussed, in the light of the continuing burden of RSV disease, the limited treatment modalities, and the continuing research for a vaccine.  2008 Expert Reviews Ltd.

429,"Prevention of respiratory syncytial virus infection with palivizumab Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infects virtually all children by the age of 2 yrs. Premature infants with chronic lung disease (CLD) are at risk of greater morbidity due to RSV infection. However, these infants represent a small proportion of all infants admitted to hospital with RSV infection, and hospitalization rates for this group appear to have decreased over the past decade. Prophylaxis against RSV infection has recently become available in the form of palivizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody preparation. The IMpact trial demonstrated a 39% relative risk reduction in hospital admissions for RSV in cases in which palivizumab was administered to premature infants with CLD. However, palivizumab is a very expensive drug and cost-effectiveness analyses do not support its use in the majority of premature infants with or without CLD. The only group in which palivizumab should even be considered for use is premature infants with chronic lung disease at home on oxygen during their first respiratory syncytial virus season. In this group of infants, a detailed postlicensing audit needs to be performed to determine efficacy. (Thomas M.; Bedford-Russell A.; Sharland M.)

430,"An evaluation of the emerging interventions against Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)-associated acute lower respiratory infections in children. Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is the leading cause of acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) in children. It is estimated to cause approximately 33.8 million new episodes of ALRI in children annually, 96% of these occurring in developing countries. It is also estimated to result in about 53,000 to 199,000 deaths annually in young children. Currently there are several vaccine and immunoprophylaxis candidates against RSV in the developmental phase targeting active and passive immunization. We used a modified CHNRI methodology for setting priorities in health research investments. This was done in two stages. In Stage I, we systematically reviewed the literature related to emerging vaccines against RSV relevant to 12 criteria of interest. In Stage II, we conducted an expert opinion exercise by inviting 20 experts (leading basic scientists, international public health researchers, international policy makers and representatives of pharmaceutical companies). The policy makers and industry representatives accepted our invitation on the condition of anonymity, due to the sensitive nature of their involvement in such exercises. They answered questions from the CHNRI framework and their ""collective optimism"" towards each criterion was documented on a scale from 0 to 100%. In the case of candidate vaccines for active immunization of infants against RSV, the experts expressed very low levels of optimism for low product cost, affordability and low cost of development; moderate levels of optimism regarding the criteria of answerability, likelihood of efficacy, deliverability, sustainability and acceptance to end users for the interventions; and high levels of optimism regarding impact on equity and acceptance to health workers. While considering the candidate vaccines targeting pregnant women, the panel expressed low levels of optimism for low product cost, affordability, answerability and low development cost; moderate levels of optimism for likelihood of efficacy, deliverability, sustainability and impact on equity; high levels of optimism regarding acceptance to end users and health workers. The group also evaluated immunoprophylaxis against RSV using monoclonal antibodies and expressed no optimism towards low product cost; very low levels of optimism regarding deliverability, affordability, sustainability, low implementation cost and impact on equity; moderate levels of optimism against the criteria of answerability, likelihood of efficacy, acceptance to end-users and health workers; and high levels of optimism regarding low development cost. They felt that either of these vaccines would have a high impact on reducing burden of childhood ALRI due to RSV and reduce the overall childhood ALRI burden by a maximum of about 10%. Although monoclonal antibodies have proven to be effective in providing protection to high-risk infants, their introduction in resource poor settings might be limited by high cost associated with them. Candidate vaccines for active immunization of infants against RSV hold greatest promise. Introduction of a low cost vaccine against RSV would reduce the inequitable distribution of burden due to childhood ALRI and will most likely have a high impact on morbidity and mortality due to severe ALRI.

431,"Defining the vaccination window for Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) using ageseroprevalence data for children in Kilifi, Kenya Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an important cause of lower respiratory tract disease in early life and a target for vaccine prevention. Data on the age-prevalence of RSV specific antibodies will inform on optimizing vaccine delivery. Methods: Archived plasma samples were randomly selected within age strata from 960 children less than 145 months of age admitted to Kilifi County Hospital pediatric wards between 2007 and 2010. Samples were tested for antibodies to RSV using crude virus IgG ELISA. Seroprevalence (and 95% confidence intervals) was estimated as the proportion of children with specific antibodies above a defined cut-off level. Nested catalytic models were used to explore different assumptions on antibody dynamics and estimate the rates of decay of RSV specific maternal antibody and acquisition of infection with age, and the average age of infection. Results: RSV specific antibody prevalence was 100% at age 0-<1month, declining rapidly over the first 6 months of life, followed by an increase in the second half of the first year of life and beyond. Seroprevalence was lowest throughout the age range 5-11 months; all children were seropositive beyond 3 years of age. The best fit model to the data yielded estimates for the rate of infection of 0.78/person/year (95% CI 0.65-0.97) and 1.69/person/year (95% CI 1.27-2.04) for ages 0-<1 year and 1-<12 years, respectively. The rate of loss of maternal antibodies was estimated as 2.54/year (95% CI 2.30-2.90), i.e. mean duration 4.7 months. The mean age at primary infection was estimated at 15 months (95% CI 13-18). Conclusions: The rate of decay of maternal antibody prevalence and subsequent age-acquisition of infection are rapid, and the average age at primary infection early. The vaccination window is narrow, and suggests optimal targeting of vaccine to infants 5 months and above to achieve high seroconversion.

432,"Low incidence of severe respiratory syncytial virus infections in lung transplant recipients despite the absence of specific therapy Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections in lung transplant recipients (LTRs) have been associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Immunoglobulins, ribavirin, and palivizumab are suggested treatments for both pre-emptive and therapeutic purposes. However, in the absence of randomized, placebo-controlled trials, efficacy is controversial and there is toxicity as well as cost concerns. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed cases of lower respiratory tract RSV infections in adult LTRs. Diagnosis was based on clinical history, combined with a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and/or viral cultures of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens. Results: Ten symptomatic patients were identified (7 men and 3 women, age range 28 to 64 years). All were hospitalized for community-acquired respiratory tract infections. Two patients had a concomitant acute Grade A3 graft rejection, and 1 patient had a concomitant bacterial pneumonia. Eight patients did not receive a specific anti-RSV treatment because of clinical stability and/or improvement at the time of RSV diagnosis. Only 2 patients (1 with Grade A3 allograft rejection and 1 requiring mechanical ventilation) received ribavirin and palivizumab. All patients recovered without complications and with no persistent RSV infection. However, bronchiolitis obliterans (BOS) staging worsened in 6 patients during the mean follow-up of 45 months. Conclusions: Our data suggest that mild RSV infections in LTRs might evolve favorably in the absence of specific anti-viral therapy. However, this observation needs confirmation in a large clinical trial specifically investigating the development of BOS in untreated vs treated patients.  2010 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

433,"Influenza A (H1N1) and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Coinfection in a Newborn Child: A Case Report This paper presents a case of coinfection of influenza A virus (H1N1) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in a male newborn. On the first day of life, the newborn required passive oxygen therapy, followed by respiratory support with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) due to respiratory insufficiency. As the newborns respiratory effort was intensifying, he was intubated. In the second day of life, a nasopharyngeal swab was taken yielding the presence of H1N1 and RSV in the RT-PCR test. The child was isolated and given oseltamivir and empirical antibiotic therapy, which improved his condition. Other newborns who initially stayed with the sick child in the post-delivery room did not obtain oseltamivir prophylactically as their nasopharyngeal swabs were negative. The childs parents denied the occurrence of influenza-like symptoms within 14 days of delivery, which suggests a transplacental transmission of the childs infection or asymptomatic course of infection in the parents. In conclusion, this report confirms the possibility of viral coinfections in newborns, which points attention to considering a panel of respiratory viruses in the diagnostics. Symptoms of influenza in newborns may be atypical, including a fever-free course. Oseltamivir treatment in newborns with influenza seems an effective therapeutic measure.

434,"Long-term effects of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis in infants and young children: A quantitative review One of the major questions regarding long-term side effects of bronchiolitis by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is whether or not it induces asthma in later life. In this quantitative review, the data of 10 controlled studies are analysed. Methods: Follow-up studies of RSV bronchiolitis published between January 1978 and December 1998 were identified through a MEDLINE search. Studies were selected if (i) postnatal age at the time of the inital illness was below 12 mo, (ii) all children were hospitalized for RSV bronchiolitis, (iii) the diagnosis RSV was virologically confirmed in all cases, and (iv) a control group was used. Results: Six studies met all selection criteria. Up to 5 y of follow-up after RSV bronchiolitis in infancy, 40% of children reported wheezing as compared to only 11% in the control group (p < 0.001). Between 5 and 10 y of follow-up 22% of the bronchiolitis group reported wheezing against 10% of the control group (p = 0.19). The incidence of recurrent wheezing as defined by three or more wheezing episodes also decreased with increasing years of follow-up: at 5 or more years of follow-up the difference between the RSV group and the control group was no longer significant. Furthermore, the presence of either a personal and/or a family history of either atopy and/or asthma did not differ between the two groups. Conclusions: Wheezing is common after RSV bronchiolitis in infancy. It may persist for 5 y of follow-up. However, no significant difference between the RSV bronchiolitis and the control group was observed regarding recurrent wheezing by 5 y of follow-up. No significant difference between the RSV bronchiolitis and the control group were found regarding a personal history of atopy, a family history of atopy and/or asthma. Therefore it seems unlikely that RSV bronchiolitis is a cause of atopic asthma in later life. (Kneyber M.C.J.; Steyerberg E.W.; De Groot R.; Moll H.A.)

435,"Aetiology and clinical presentation of pneumonia in hospitalized and outpatient children in Northeast Brazil and risk factors for severity Data on presentation, aetiology, and prognostic indicators of childhood pneumonia, which can help design strategies for controlling the disease, are generally scarce in developing countries. In this paper, the distribution of aetiologic agents, clinical presentation, and evolution of pneumonia cases are described, and the factors associated with duration of pneumonia episode and of hospital admission examined. During June 1994-June 1995, 472 children, aged 6-59 months, with clinical diagnosis of pneumonia, who were admitted to hospital or treated as outpatients, were investigated in Recife, Northeast Brazil. Pneumonia, in most cases, was confirmed by radiology. A combination of methods was used for investigating the aetiology of pneumonia. Data obtained on a large number of clinical, socioeconomic and biological variables were analyzed to determine the prognostic factors for the severity and outcome of pneumonia. Bacteria were identified in 26.7% of the cases, while viruses and mixed infections accounted for 8.4% and 2.7% respectively. Haemophilus influenzae (18.9%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6.4%), and respiratory syncytial virus (5.0%) were most often identified. The pneumonia case-fatality rate was 0.8%. The best clinical predictors of severity were: lung complications at baseline, tachypnoea (for duration of episode), and chest indrawing (for duration of hospital admission). Young age, low birth-weight, and prolonged fever prior to admission to the study also predicted a more prolonged illness, and under-nutrition was a predictor of longer hospital stay. While the development of new vaccines is an important measure for reducing morbidity and mortality due to pneumonia, emphasis on appropriate case management needs to be maintained, with particular attention to children who show the identified risk factors for a poor prognosis.  2005 ICDDR,B: Centre for Health and Population Research.

436,"Pediatricians' attitudes and costs of bronchiolitis in the emergency department: A prospective multicentre study Background: How pediatricians manage bronchiolitis and the derived total costs (direct and indirect) in the emergency department (ED) have not been fully characterized. The aim of the present study is to calculate those costs in a European country.Methods: A prospective and observational study, including 10 EDs of tertiary hospitals throughout Spain and during the bronchiolitis season 2010-2011, was performed. Every ED recruited children on random days of the week (3 days per week; always including one non-working day per every week). Recruitment aimed at a total sample size of 600 children. Direct (diagnostic procedures, time spent in the ED and medication) and indirect costs (work hours lost by parents, babysitting, travels, and meals) were collected. Comparisons between bronchiolitis caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and non-RSV bronchiolitis, as well as costs across severity categories were performed with the Kruskal-Wallis test. A multiple regression model was built to assess the influence of several of the studied factors on the total costs, including a RSV positive test and episode severity as independent variables; and gender, age, attending nursery school, pretermbirth, low birth weight, smoker mother during pregnancy, and current smoker father as covariates.Results: From the 664 recruited children, direct mean costs were 213.291.8 and indirect ones were 35.955.3; the total costs being 249.2122.9. Costs were significantly higher in children positive to RSV and rose with increased severity. Those associations were maintained in the multiple regression analysis.Conclusions: Although relatively low at the individual level (249.2, mean total cost) the costs for just the ED expenses of bronchiolitis in Spain would add up to about 20 million per year.

437,"Single-Center Experience in Detecting Influenza Virus, RSV and SARS-CoV-2 at the Emergency Department Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on respiratory tract swabs has become the gold standard for sensitive and specific detection of influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In this retrospective analysis, we report on the successive implementation and routine use of multiplex RT-PCR testing for patients admitted to the Internal Medicine Emergency Department (ED) at a tertiary care center in Western Austria, one of the hotspots in the early coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Europe. Our description focuses on the use of the Cepheid() Xpert() Xpress closed RT-PCR system in point-of-care testing (POCT). Our indications for RT-PCR testing changed during the observation period: From the cold season 2016/2017 until the cold season 2019/2020, we used RT-PCR to diagnose influenza or RSV infection in patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms. Starting in March 2020, we used the RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 and a multiplex version for the combined detection of all these three respiratory viruses to also screen subjects who did not present with symptoms of infection but needed in-hospital medical treatment for other reasons. Expectedly, the switch to a more liberal RT-PCR test strategy resulted in a substantial increase in the number of tests. Nevertheless, we observed an immediate decline in influenza virus and RSV detections in early 2020 that coincided with public SARS-CoV-2 containment measures. In contrast, the extensive use of the combined RT-PCR test enabled us to monitor the re-emergence of influenza and RSV detections, including asymptomatic cases, at the end of 2022 when COVID-19 containment measures were no longer in place. Our analysis of PCR results for respiratory viruses from a real-life setting at an ED provides valuable information on the epidemiology of those infections over several years, their contribution to morbidity and need for hospital admission, the risk for nosocomial introduction of such infection into hospitals from asymptomatic carriers, and guidance as to how general precautions and prophylactic strategies affect the dynamics of those infections.

438,"Respiratory syncytial virus infections Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a seasonally occurring, worldwide distributed airway pathogen and the most common cause for severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants. The RSV affects all age groups but in premature infants, immunodeficient patients and older people over the age of 65 years it is associated with a significant morbidity and mortality. No specific antiviral treatment is so far available and RSV bronchiolitis treatment remains only supportive with oxygen and fluid supplementation and non(invasive) ventilation. A passive immunization with palivizumab, a monoclonal antibody administered during the RSV season, is indicated in high-risk patients for avoidance of severe courses. Currently, however, many novel active RSV vaccines and antiviral substances are being clinically tested and should become available in the upcoming years.

439,"Mortality and morbidity among infants at high risk for severe respiratory syncytial virus infection receiving prophylaxis with palivizumab: A systematic literature review and meta-analysis Objectives: A systematic literature review and meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of prophylaxis with palivizumab on mortality and morbidity associated with respiratory syncytial virus infection in infants at high risk (35 wks of gestational age, chronic lung disease, or congenital heart disease). Data Sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Current Contents were used. MEDLINE was searched from January 1, 1990 to May 16, 2007. The bibliographies of accepted studies and recent reviews and proceedings from the past 2 yrs were searched to identify additional relevant studies. Study Selection: Randomized controlled trials and prospective or retrospective cohort studies evaluating all-cause and respiratory syncytial virus-specific mortality, respiratory syncytial virus hospitalizations, and health care use in infants at high risk for respiratory syncytial virus infection receiving prophylaxis with palivizumab. Data Extraction: Data elements from each accepted study were extracted by one researcher and confirmed by a second researcher. Differences were resolved before data entry and analysis. Data Synthesis: A total of 2473 citations were screened and ten comparative studies of palivizumab prophylaxis evaluating >15,000 infants were included. Comparisons of mortality and hospitalization outcomes between infant groups using prophylaxis and not using prophylaxis were made using meta-analyses. Conclusions: Prophylaxis and nonprophylaxis infant groups appeared to be comparable at baseline. All-cause mortality during the respiratory syncytial virus season was 12 of 6380 (0.19%) for infants with prophylaxis vs. 33 of 8182 (0.53%) for infants without prophylaxis (Peto odds ratio, 0.30; 95% confidence interval, 0.17- 0.55). Only five respiratory syncytial virus-specific deaths were reported, and the majority of the studies did not report respiratory syncytial virus-related deaths. The rate of respiratory syncytial virus hospitalization was significantly lower among preterm infants with prophylaxis compared with those without prophylaxis (4.1% vs. 10.4%; odds ratio, 0.35; 95% confidence interval, 0.25- 0.47). Prophylaxis with palivizumab was associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality and respiratory syncytial virus hospitalization among preterm infants at high risk. Additional research on cause of death among infants at high risk is needed.

440,"Influence of Sex on Respiratory Syncytial Virus Genotype Infection Frequency and Nasopharyngeal Microbiome Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has a significant health burden in children, older adults, and the immunocompromised. However, limited effort has been made to identify emergence of new RSV genotypes' frequency of infection and how the combination of nasopharyngeal microbiome and viral genotypes impact RSV disease outcomes. In an observational cohort designed to capture the first infant RSV infection, we employed multi-omics approaches to sequence 349 RSV complete genomes and matched nasopharyngeal microbiomes, during which the 2012/2013 season was dominated by RSV-A, whereas 2013 and 2014 was dominated by RSV-B. We found non-G-72nt-duplicated RSV-A strains were more frequent in male infants (P = 0.02), whereas G-72nt-duplicated genotypes (which is ON1 lineage) were seen equally in both males and females. DESeq2 testing of the nasal microbiome showed Haemophilus was significantly more abundant in infants with RSV-A infection compared to infants with RSV-B infection (adjusted P = 0.002). In addition, the broad microbial clustering of the abundant genera was significantly associated with infant sex (P = 0.03). Overall, we show sex differences in infection by RSV genotype and host nasopharyngeal microbiome, suggesting an interaction between host genetics, virus genotype, and associated nasopharyngeal microbiome. IMPORTANCE Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the leading causes of lower respiratory tract infections in young children and is responsible for high hospitalization rates and morbidity in infants and the elderly. To understand how the emergence of RSV viral genotypes and viral-respiratory microbiome interactions contribute to infection frequency and severity, we utilized an observational cohort designed to capture the first infant RSV infection we employed multi-omics approaches to sequence 349 RSV complete genomes and matched nasopharyngeal microbiomes. We found non-G-72nt-duplicated RSV-A genotypes were more frequent in male infants, whereas G-72nt-duplicated RSV-A strains (ON1 lineage) were seen equally in both males and females. Microbiome analysis show Haemophilus was significantly more abundant in infants with RSV-A compared to infants with RSV-B infection and the microbial clustering of the abundant genera was associated with infant sex. Overall, we show sex differences in RSV genotype-nasopharyngeal microbiome, suggesting an interaction host genetics-virus-microbiome interaction. (Tan Y.; Shilts M.H.; Das S.R.)

441,"The economics of strategies to reduce respiratory syncytial virus hospitalizations in Alaska Background. Alaska Native infants experience high rates of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) hospitalizations. Through 2008, Alaska administered a 7-dose (maximum) palivizumab regime to high-risk infants from October to May. In 2009, the maximum was reduced to 3 doses for 32- to 34-week preterm babies and 6 doses for other groups. Methods. We used 11 years of data and regional Medicaid reimbursement rates to model the cost effectiveness of 4 palivizumab intervention strategies to reduce RSV hospitalizations among Alaskan infants including: current strategy, old strategy (1998-2008), and 2 hypothetical strategies using the current strategy plus 1 or 3 doses to all newborn infants during the RSV season. Results. The current strategy represents 5 hospitalizations averted per year for the palivizumab cohort (~50-56 children) at ~$52 846 per hospitalization averted, compared with no intervention. Compared with the old strategy, the mean cost per hospitalization prevented for the current strategy was 63% lower, net program costs were 85% lower, and the mean hospitalizations prevented were 27% lower. Compared with current strategy only, the addition of 1 dose to all newborns during the RSV season could decrease the mean cost per hospitalization prevented by 23%, increase the number of hospitalizations prevented by 2.5-fold, and increase the net programmatic costs by 3.3-fold; administering up to 3 doses to infants further reduced hospitalizations and increased costs. Conclusions. The current palivizumab strategy improved the cost-effectiveness ratio compared with the old strategy. Further improvement could be obtained by adding doses for Alaskan Native newborns during the RSV season; however, programmatic costs would increase.

442,"Defining the Risk and Associated Morbidity and Mortality of Severe Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection Among Preterm Infants Without Chronic Lung Disease or Congenital Heart Disease Introduction: The REGAL (RSV Evidencea Geographical Archive of the Literature) series provide a comprehensive review of the published evidence in the field of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in Western countries over the last 20 years. This second publication covers the risk and burden of RSV infection in preterm infants born at <37 weeks gestational age (wGA) without chronic lung disease or congenital heart disease. Methods: A systematic review was undertaken for articles published between January 1, 1995 and December 31, 2015. Studies reporting data for hospital visits/admissions for RSV infection among preterm infants as well as studies reporting RSV-associated morbidity, mortality, and risk factors were included. Study quality and strength of evidence (SOE) were graded using recognized criteria. Results: 2469 studies were identified of which 85 were included. Preterm infants, particularly those born at lower wGA, tended to have higher RSV hospitalization (RSVH) rates compared with otherwise healthy term infants (high SOE). RSVH rates ranged from ~5 per 1000 children to >100 per 1000 children with the highest rates shown in the lowest gestational age infants (high SOE). Independent risk factors associated with RSVH include: proximity of birth to the RSV season, living with school-age siblings, smoking of mother during pregnancy or infant exposure to environmental smoking, reduced breast feeding, male sex, and familial atopy (asthma) (high SOE). Predictive models can identify 32/3335 wGA infants at risk of RSVH (high SOE). Conclusion: RSV infection remains a major burden on Western healthcare systems and is associated with significant morbidity. Further studies focusing on the prevalence and burden of RSV in different gestational age cohorts, the changing risk of RSVH during the first year of life, and on RSV-related mortality in preterm infants are needed to determine the true burden of disease.

443,"Prevalence of infant bronchiolitis-coded healthcare encounters attributable to RSV Aim: We sought to determine the proportion of bronchiolitis episodes attributable to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) among ICD-9 coded infant bronchiolitis episodes which were tested for RSV. Methods: Bronchiolitis healthcare encounters were extracted from Kaiser Permanente Northern California databases for years 2006 to 2009. We used ICD-9 codes for bronchiolitis to capture bronchiolitis-related healthcare encounters including hospital admissions (Hospitalization), emergency department visits (EDV), and outpatient visits (OPV). We reported the monthly proportion of RSV-positive bronchiolitis episodes among tested bronchiolitis episodes. We used logistic regression to assess association between bronchiolitis episodes and patient demographic and health care characteristics. We also used logistic regression to assess association between decision to test and patient demographics and health care characteristics. Results: Among 10,411 ICD-9 coded infant bronchiolitis episodes, 29% were RSV tested. Fifty one percent of those tested were RSV positive. Between December and February, and in infants 6 months, the proportion of bronchiolitis episodes that were attributable to RSV was 77.2% among hospitalized episodes, 78.3% among EDV episodes, and 60.9% among OPV episodes, respectively. The proportion of RSV-positive bronchiolitis episodes varied based upon infant age at diagnosis, level of health care service used, and time of the year of the episode. Conclusion: Estimation of the proportion of ICD-9 coded bronchiolitis episodes attributable to RSV is more specific when restricting to bronchiolitis episodes during peak months, younger infant age, and those requiring higher level of healthcare.

445,"Infants Admitted to US Intensive Care Units for RSV Infection During the 2022 Seasonal Peak Importance: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) and infant hospitalization worldwide. Objective: To evaluate the characteristics and outcomes of RSV-related critical illness in US infants during peak 2022 RSV transmission. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study used a public health prospective surveillance registry in 39 pediatric hospitals across 27 US states. Participants were infants admitted for 24 or more hours between October 17 and December 16, 2022, to a unit providing intensive care due to laboratory-confirmed RSV infection. Exposure: Respiratory syncytial virus. Main Outcomes and Measures: Data were captured on demographics, clinical characteristics, signs and symptoms, laboratory values, severity measures, and clinical outcomes, including receipt of noninvasive respiratory support, invasive mechanical ventilation, vasopressors or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and death. Mixed-effects multivariable log-binomial regression models were used to assess associations between intubation status and demographic factors, gestational age, and underlying conditions, including hospital as a random effect to account for between-site heterogeneity. Results: The first 15 to 20 consecutive eligible infants from each site were included for a target sample size of 600. Among the 600 infants, the median (IQR) age was 2.6 (1.4-6.0) months; 361 (60.2%) were male, 169 (28.9%) were born prematurely, and 487 (81.2%) had no underlying medical conditions. Primary reasons for admission included LRTI (594 infants [99.0%]) and apnea or bradycardia (77 infants [12.8%]). Overall, 143 infants (23.8%) received invasive mechanical ventilation (median [IQR], 6.0 [4.0-10.0] days). The highest level of respiratory support for nonintubated infants was high-flow nasal cannula (243 infants [40.5%]), followed by bilevel positive airway pressure (150 infants [25.0%]) and continuous positive airway pressure (52 infants [8.7%]). Infants younger than 3 months, those born prematurely (gestational age <37 weeks), or those publicly insured were at higher risk for intubation. Four infants (0.7%) received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and 2 died. The median (IQR) length of hospitalization for survivors was 5 (4-10) days. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study, most US infants who required intensive care for RSV LRTIs were young, healthy, and born at term.

446,"Risk of mortality associated with respiratory syncytial virus and influenza infection in adults Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection constitutes a substantial disease burden in the general population. However, the risk of death for RSV infection has been rarely evaluated with confounders or comorbidities adjusted. We aimed to evaluate whether RSV infection is associated with higher mortality than seasonal influenza after adjusting for confounders and comorbidities and the effect of oseltamivir on the mortality in patients with influenza infection. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on adult (18 years) patients admitted to the emergency department and ward of a university teaching hospital for suspected viral infection during 2013-2015 (N = 3743). RSV infection was diagnosed by multiplex PCR (N = 87). Adults hospitalized for seasonal influenza during the study period were enrolled as a comparison group (n = 312). The main outcome was 20-day all-cause mortality.We used Cox proportional hazard regression analyses to calculate the relative risk of death. Results: Adult patients were less likely to be diagnosed with RSV than with influenza (2.3 vs 8.3%, respectively), were older and more likely to be diagnosed with pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypoxemia, and bacterial co-infection. In patients with RSV infection, the 20-day all-cause mortality was higher than that for influenza, (18.4 vs 6.7%, respectively). RSV infection showed significantly higher risk of death compared to the seasonal influenza group, with hazard ratio, 2.32 (95% CI, 1.17-4.58).

447,"Lumicitabine, an orally administered nucleoside analog, in infants hospitalized with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection: Safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic results Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is the leading cause of infant hospitalizations and mortality. Lumicitabine, an oral nucleoside analog was studied for the treatment of RSV. The phase 1b and phase 2b studies reported here assessed the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of lumicitabine in infants/neonates hospitalized with RSV. In the phase 1b study, infants (1 to 12 months) and neonates (<28 days) received a single-ascending or multiple-ascending doses (single loading dose [LD] then 9 maintenance doses [MD] of lumicitabine, or placebo [3:1]). In the phase 2b study, infants/children (28 days to 36 months old) received lumicitabine 40/20 mg/kg, 60/40 mg/kg LD/MD twice-daily or placebo (1:1:1) for 5 days. Safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy parameters were assessed over 28 days. Lumicitabine was associated with a dose-related increase in the incidence and severity of reversible neutropenia. Plasma levels of ALS-008112, the active nucleoside analog, were dose-proportional with comparable mean exposure levels at the highest doses in both studies. There were no significant differences between the lumicitabine groups and placebo in reducing viral load, time to viral non-detectability, and symptom resolution. No emergent resistance-associated substitutions were observed at the RSV L-gene positions of interest. In summary, lumicitabine was associated with a dose-related increase in the incidence and severity of reversible neutropenia and failed to demonstrate antiviral activity in RSV-infected hospitalized infants. This contrasts with the findings of the previous RSV-A adult challenge study where significant antiviral activity was noted, without incidence of neutropenia.

448,"Model evaluation of target product profiles of an infant vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in a developed country setting Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of lower respiratory tract disease in children worldwide and is a significant cause of hospital admissions in young children in England. No RSV vaccine has been licensed but a number are under development. In this work, we present two structurally distinct mathematical models, parameterized using RSV data from the UK, which have been used to explore the effect of introducing an RSV paediatric vaccine to the National programme. We have explored different vaccine properties, and dosing regimens combined with a range of implementation strategies for RSV control. The results suggest that vaccine properties that confer indirect protection have the greatest effect in reducing the burden of disease in children under 5 years. The findings are reinforced by the concurrence of predictions from the two models with very different epidemiological structure. The approach described has general application in evaluating vaccine target product profiles.

449,"Immunogenicity and safety of a respiratory syncytial virus fusion protein (RSV F) nanoparticle vaccine in older adults Background: A preventative strategy for Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infection constitutes an under-recognized unmet medical need among older adults. Four formulations of a novel recombinant RSV F nanoparticle vaccine (60 or 90g RSV F protein, with or without aluminum phosphate adjuvant) administered concurrently with a licensed inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) in older adult subjects were evaluated for safety and immunogenicity in this randomized, observer-blinded study. Results: A total of 220 healthy males and females60years of age, without symptomatic cardiopulmonary disease, were vaccinated concurrently with TIV and RSV F vaccine or placebo. All vaccine formulations produced an acceptable safety profile, with no vaccine-related serious adverse events or evidence of systemic toxicity. Vaccine-induced immune responses were rapid, rising as early as 7days post-vaccination; and were comparable in all formulations in terms of magnitude, with maximal levels attained within 28 (unadjuvanted) or 56 (adjuvanted) days post-vaccination. Peak anti-F protein IgG antibody levels rose 3.6- to 5.6-fold, with an adjuvant effect observed at the 60g dose, and a dose-effect observed between the unadjuvanted 60 and 90g regimens. The anti-F response persisted through 12months post-vaccination. Palivizumab-competitive antibodies were below quantifiable levels (<33g/mL) at day 0. The rise of antibodies with specificity for Site II peptide, and the palivizumab-competitive binding activity, denoting antibodies binding at, or in proximity to, antigenic Site II on the F protein, closely paralleled the anti-F response. However, a larger proportion of antibodies in adjuvanted vaccine recipients bound to the Site II peptide at high avidity. Day 0 neutralizing antibodies were high in all subjects and rose 1.3- to 1.7-fold in response to vaccination. Importantly, the RSV F vaccine co-administered with TIV did not impact the serum hemagglutination inhibition antibody responses to a standard-dose TIV, and TIV did not impact the immune response to the RSV F vaccine. Conclusions: RSV F protein nanoparticle vaccine induced increases in measures of functional immunity to RSV in older adults and demonstrated an acceptable safety profile. Adjuvanted formulations provided additional immunogenicity benefit as compared to increasing antigen dose alone. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT01709019.

450,"Respiratory syncytial virus Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is the main cause of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in infants and children around the world. S.pneumonia, H.influenza and RSV are the most common microorganisms. Isolation ratio of RSV is one of the important causes of mortality in LRTI which ranges between 30-90% in RSV, 50-90% in bronchiolitis and 30-60% in pneumonia. The course of RSV infection is usually mild but 1% of the previously healthy children and 50% of the children in the risk group (cardiopulmonary disease, immundeficiency, prematures) need hospitalization. The most common important strategy in decreasing the spread of RSV infections is the education of the health personnel about epidemiology of RSV, rapid diagnosis and treatment of RSV infections.

451,"Respiratory syncytial virus hospitalisation trends in children with haemodynamically significant heart disease, 1997-2012 Objective The aim of the study was to evaluate the trends in respiratory syncytial virus-related hospitalisations and associated outcomes in children with haemodynamically significant heart disease in the United States of America. Study design The Kids' Inpatient Databases (1997-2012) were used to estimate the incidence of respiratory syncytial virus hospitalisation among children 24 months with or without haemodynamically significant heart disease. Weighted multivariable logistic regression and chi-square tests were used to evaluate the trends over time and factors associated with hospitalisation, comparing eras before and after publication of the 2003 American Academy of Pediatrics palivizumab immunoprophylaxis guidelines. Secondary outcomes included in-hospital mortality, morbidity, length of stay, and cost. Results Overall, 549,265 respiratory syncytial virus-related hospitalisations were evaluated, including 2518 (0.5%) in children with haemodynamically significant heart disease. The incidence of respiratory syncytial virus hospitalisation in children with haemodynamically significant heart disease decreased by 36% when comparing pre- and post-palivizumab guideline eras versus an 8% decline in children without haemodynamically significant heart disease (p<0.001). Children with haemodynamically significant heart disease had higher rates of respiratory syncytial virus-associated mortality (4.9 versus 0.1%, p<0.001) and morbidity (31.5 versus 3.5%, p<0.001) and longer hospital length of stay (17.9 versus 3.9 days, p<0.001) compared with children without haemodynamically significant heart disease. The mean cost of respiratory syncytial virus hospitalisation in 2009 was $58,166 (95% CI:$46,017, $70,315). Conclusions These data provide stakeholders with a means to evaluate the cost-utility of various immunoprophylaxis strategies. (Chu P.Y.)

Design: Prospective national surveillance survey. Setting: All PICUs in Israel. Patients or participants: All patients admitted to a PICU because of acute bronchiolitis in two consecutive RSV seasons (November 2000 to April 2001 and November 2001 to April 2002). Methods: Data on demographic and epidemiologic factors and RSV prophylaxis status were collected for every infant with bronchiolitis who was admitted to a PICU in Israel in the year before and after issuance of the Israel Ministry of Health recommendation for palivizumab prophylaxis (January 2001). Results: One hundred five patients were admitted to a PICU because of RSV bronchiolitis in the year before the recommendations were issued, and 123 patients were admitted in the year after they were issued. Mechanical ventilation was required by 33 and 42 children, respectively. Gestational age was > 32 weeks in 92.9% and 83.9% of the admitted patients, respectively, and 89% and 91% of the patients, respectively, were free of chronic lung disease (CLD). In both periods, 83% of the children who were admitted to a PICU did not meet the American Academy of Pediatrics criteria for RSV prophylaxis. Conclusions: Most of the children with severe RSV bronchiolitis needing PICU admission from 2000 to 2002 born at term did not have CLD and were not candidates for RSV prophylaxis according to the current recommendations.

453,"Determining the Relationship of Meteorological Factors and Severe Pediatric Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Infection in Central Peninsular Malaysia Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common pathogen causing viral respiratory tract infections among younger children worldwide. The influence of meteorological factors on RSV seasonal activity is well-established for temperate countries; however, in subtropical countries such as Malaysia, relatively stable temperate climates do not clearly support this trend, and the available data are contradictory. Better understanding of meteorological factors and seasonality of RSV will allow effective strategic health management relating to RSV infection, particularly immunoprophylaxis of high-risk infants with palivizumab. Retrospectively, from 2017 to 2021, we examined the association between various meteorological factors (rainfall, rainy days, temperature, and relative humidity) and the incidence of RSV in children aged less than 12 years in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. RSV activity peaked in two periods (July to August and October to December), which was significantly correlated with the lowest rainfall (p < 0.007) and number of rainy days (p < 0.005). RSV prevalence was also positively associated with temperature (p < 0.006) and inversely associated with relative humidity (p < 0.006). Based on our findings, we recommend that immunoprophylaxis with palivizumab be administered in children aged less than 2 years where transmission of RSV is postulated to be the highest after the end of two monsoon seasons.

A prospective study was undertaken to compare the performance characteristics of the BD and BN assays using 99 fresh nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens from children. All specimens were cultured by tube cultures and R-mix shell vials. Culture-negative specimens that tested positive by 1 or both antigen tests were analyzed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the presence of RSV nucleic acids. Specimens positive by culture and/or RT-PCR were considered true positives. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for BD were 90%, 94%, 94%, and 90%, respectively, and those for BN were 90%, 100%, 100%, and 90% respectively. The overall agreement between the 2 assays was 93% (confidence interval, 86.3-96.6%). Three specimens negative by both assays were positive by viral culture. The rapid lateral flow immunochromatographic assays were easy to perform and easy to interpret, and the results are available in less than 30 min.

455,"Mortality associated with influenza and respiratory syncytial virus in the United States Context: Influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) cause substantial morbidity and mortality. Statistical methods used to estimate deaths in the United States attributable to influenza have not accounted for RSV circulation. Objective: To develop a statistical model using national mortality and viral surveillance data to estimate annual influenza- and RSV-associated deaths in the United States, by age group, virus, and influenza type and subtype. Design, Setting, and Population: Age-specific Poisson regression models using national viral surveillance data for the 1976-1977 through 1998-1999 seasons were used to estimate influenza-associated deaths. Influenza- and RSV-associated deaths were simultaneously estimated for the 1990-1991 through 1998-1999 seasons. Main Outcome Measures: Attributable deaths for 3 categories: underlying pneumonia and influenza, underlying respiratory and circulatory, and all causes. Results Annual estimates of influenza-associated deaths increased significantly between the 1976-1977 and 1998-1999 seasons for all 3 death categories (P<.001 for each category). For the 1990-1991 through 1998-1999 seasons, the greatest mean numbers of deaths were associated with influenza A(H3N2) viruses, followed by RSV, influenza B, and influenza A(H1N1). Influenza viruses and RSV, respectively, were associated with annual means (SD) of 8097 (3084) and 2707 (196) underlying pneumonia and influenza deaths, 36155 (11055) and 11321 (668) underlying respiratory and circulatory deaths, and 51203 (15081) and 17358 (1086) all-cause deaths. For underlying respiratory and circulatory deaths, 90% of influenza- and 78% of RSV-associated deaths occurred among persons aged 65 years or older. Influenza was associated with more deaths than RSV in all age groups except for children younger than 1 year. On average, influenza was associated with 3 times as many deaths as RSV. Conclusions: Mortality associated with both influenza and RSV circulation disproportionately affects elderly persons. Influenza deaths have increased substantially in the last 2 decades, in part because of aging of the population, underscoring the need for better prevention measures, including more effective vaccines and vaccination programs for elderly persons.

456,"Immunoprophylaxis with Palivizumab for prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection: Indication for use and preliminary data Background: Monthly intramuscular Palivizumab (Synagis , MedImmune, Inc.) is effective in reducing the incidence of RSV-attributable hospitalization by 55% if compared with placebo and seems to be well tolerated. Methods: Our clinical experience in the use of palivizumab in RSV-prophylaxis is presented. During autumn-winter 1999-2000, a total of 8 newborns (gestational age between 28-34 weeks) in our neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) met the AAP recommendations for RSV-immunoprophylaxis. Palivizumab was monthly administered at a dosage of 15mg/kg i.m. at discharge from the NICU and during the RSV season. Infants were followed up to 40 days from the last injection for adverse reactions and clinical data. Results: Among eligible newborns, two (28 and 29 weeks respectively) were affected by CLD and required medical therapy at discharge, 4 were born at 29-32 weeks and 2 (both of them born at 34 weeks) had additional risk factors of infection (crowded environment, passive smoking). During RSV season, none of the infants experienced RSV-hospitalization nor lower respiratory tract infection. Mild and transient adverse effects occurred in 2 cases out of 8 (induration in the site of injection and irritability). Conclusions: In our series of patients, palivizumab resulted safe and effective.

457,"Adults face increased asthma risk after infant RSV bronchiolitis and reduced respiratory health-related quality of life after RSV pneumonia Aim To evaluate the association between hospitalisation for respiratory syncytial virus lower respiratory tract infection (RSV LRTI) in infancy and asthma, respiratory health-related quality of life and lung function at 28-31 years of age. Methods In 2010, we carried out a 30-year follow-up on 43 adults admitted to Kuopio University Hospital, Finland, for RSV LRTI, 27 for bronchiolitis and 16 for pneumonia, between 1981 and 1982. Together with 86 population-based controls, they completed the Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire and underwent prebronchodilator (pre-BD) and post-BD spirometry tests to measure percentage of predicted forced vital capacity (FVC%), percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1%) and percentage of predicted FEV1/FVC (FEV1/FVC%). Results Both the pre-BD and post-BD FEV1% and FEV1/FVC% were significantly lower in former RSV LRTI patients than in the controls. The bronchiolitis patients had more asthma in adulthood than the controls and pneumonia in infancy was associated with lower St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) scores. Conclusion Respiratory tract infection LRTI hospitalisation in infancy was associated with an increased risk of permanent obstructive lung function reduction in adulthood. The asthma risk was higher after hospitalisation for bronchiolitis, than in the controls, and respiratory health-related quality of life was lower after hospitalisation for pneumonia. 2014 Foundation Acta Pdiatrica.

458,"Predicting the relative impacts of maternal and neonatal respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine target product profiles: A consensus modelling approach Background Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the major viral cause of infant and childhood lower respiratory tract disease worldwide. Defining the optimal target product profile (TPP) is complicated due to a wide range of possible vaccine properties, modalities and an incomplete understanding of the mechanism of natural immunity. We report consensus population level impact projections based on two mathematical models applied to a low income setting. Method Two structurally distinct age-specific deterministic compartmental models reflecting uncertainty associated with the natural history of infection and the mechanism by which immunity is acquired and lost were constructed. A wide range of vaccine TPPs were explored including dosing regime and uptake, and effects in the vaccinated individual on infectiousness, susceptibility, duration of protection, disease severity and interaction with maternal antibodies and natural induced immunity. These were combined with a range of vaccine implementation strategies, targeting the highest priority age group and calibrated using hospitalization data from Kilifi County Hospital, Kenya. Findings Both models were able to reproduce the data. The impact predicted by the two models was qualitatively similar across the range of TPPs, although one model consistently predicted higher impact than the other. For a proposed realistic range of scenarios of TPP combinations, the models predicted up to 70% reduction in hospitalizations in children under five years old. Vaccine designs which reduced the duration and infectiousness of infection were predicted to have higher impacts. The models were sensitive to the coverage and rate of loss of vaccine protection but not to the interaction between vaccine and maternal/naturally acquired immunity. Conclusion The results suggest that vaccine properties leading to reduced virus circulation by lessening the duration and infectiousness of infection upon challenge are of major importance in population RSV disease control. These features should be a focus for vaccine development. (Pan-Ngum W., pan@tropmedres.ac; Saralamba S.; White L.J.)

Higher preinoculation serum neutralizing antibody titers and nasal immunoglobulin (Ig) A predicted lower infectivity and lower measures of viral replication. However, once individuals were infected, no significant protective effect of preexisting antibodies was seen. Lack of correlation between serum and mucosal antibodies was observed, implying that they are independent co-correlates of protection against RSV infection.

460,"Respiratory syncytial virus infections: Characteristics and treatment In this review, we describe the history, epidemiology and clinical manifestations of infections attributed to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in children. At present, no cure exists for RSV infection but commonly employed palliative treatments include oxygen and inhaled (2)-adrenoceptor agonists, such as salbutamol, to relieve the wheezing and increased bronchiolar smooth muscle constriction. Adrenaline (epinephrine) has been found to be superior to the selective (2)-adrenoceptor agonists. Oral or inhaled corticosteroids should counteract the inflammatory response to RSV infection but their effectiveness is controversial. Inhaled ribavirin is the only licensed antiviral product approved for the treatment of RSV lower respiratory-tract infection in hospitalized children, although its use is now restricted to high-risk infants. Other treatments considered are nasopharyngeal suctioning, surfactant therapy, recombinant human deoxyribonuclease I, heliox (helium:oxygen) and inhaled nitric oxide. Prevention of infection by RSV antibodies is another strategy and, currently, palivizumab is the only safe, effective and convenient preventative treatment for RSV disease in high-risk populations of infants and young children. Its cost-effectiveness, however, has been questioned. Both live attenuated and subunit vaccines against RSV infection have been developed but so far there is no safe and effective vaccine available. Finding effective treatments and prophylactic measures remains a major challenge for the future.  2005 The Authors.

Results: We found a slight increase in primary health care use in the first four weeks after the hospital visit for infants with COVID-19 when compared to infants with RSV infection (6 [95%CI=2 to 13] per 10,000, 0.52% relative increase). For infants diagnosed with COVID-19, we found a similar post-visit increase in inpatients when compared to infants with RSV infection, which lasted for 12 weeks. Conclusions: Our findings imply slightly increased health care use among infants after hospital visit for COVID-19 than among infants with other respiratory tract infections, for which potential etiological mechanisms deserve future clinical research. Severe COVID-19 in young children will not represent any markedly increased burden on the health services. (Larsen V.B., vildebergstad.larsen@fhi.no; Telle K.; Methi F.; Magnusson K.)

462,"Expected Impact of Universal Immunization With Nirsevimab Against RSV-Related Outcomes and Costs Among All US Infants in Their First RSV Season: A Static Model Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is associated with substantial morbidity in the United States, especially among infants. Nirsevimab, an investigational long-acting monoclonal antibody, was evaluated as an immunoprophylactic strategy for infants in their first RSV season and for its potential impact on RSV-associated, medically attended lower respiratory tract illness (RSV-MALRTI) and associated costs. Methods: A static decision-analytic model of the US birth cohort during its first RSV season was developed to estimate nirsevimab's impact on RSV-related health events and costs; model inputs included US-specific costs and epidemiological data. Modelled RSV-related outcomes included primary care and emergency room visits, hospitalizations including intensive care unit admission and mechanical ventilations, and RSV-related mortality. Results: Under current standard of care, RSV caused 529 915 RSV-MALRTIs and 47 281 hospitalizations annually, representing $1.2 billion (2021 US dollars [USD]) in costs. Universal immunization of all infants with nirsevimab is expected to reduce 290 174 RSV-MALRTI, 24 986 hospitalizations, and expenditures of $612 million 2021 USD. Conclusions: An all-infant immunization strategy with nirsevimab could substantially reduce the health and economic burden for US infants during their first RSV season. While this reduction is driven by term infants, all infants, including palivizumab-eligible and preterm infants, would benefit from this strategy. (Kieffer A.; Beuvelet M.)

463,"Incidence of respiratory syncytial virus-related hospitalizations in high-risk children: Follow-up of a national cohort of infants treated with Palivizumab as RSV prophylaxis The prophylactic administration of Palivizumab, a monoclonal antibody binding the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) fusion protein, was recently shown to significantly decrease the incidence of RSV-related hospitalizations among high-risk children (IMpact-RSV trial). While awaiting marketing authorization in France and through a cohort of patients' name-based national program temporarily authorized by the French Drug Agency, a prospective register of all Palivizumab-treated patients in France was set up during the epidemic season 1999-2000. Based on this register, this study was carried out to evaluate the incidence of RSV-related hospitalizations and the safety of prophylaxis among a national cohort of children at high-risk of severe RSV disease. During the study period, guidelines issued by the French Pediatric Society recommended prophylaxis for children either aged less than 6 months at inclusion and born at less than 33 weeks of gestation with a history of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) at 28 days of life, or aged less than 2 years, born at less than 36 weeks of gestation, and having required treatment for BPD over the previous 6 months. Once included in the program, investigators were to prospectively report the clinical and demographic characteristics of children, all hospitalizations, and reasons for the hospitalizations. Five hundred and sixteen children were treated with 1-5 monthly doses. The median gestational age was 28 weeks, and children born at less than 33 weeks of gestation accounted for 88% of the cohort. The prevalence of BPD was 81%. Ninety children were hospitalized for respiratory illness. In 39 children, hospitalizations were attributed to RSV (7.6% of the total cohort). Among those 39 children, 10 (1.9% of the total cohort) required admission into an intensive care unit, and 4 required mechanical ventilation. No deaths or serious adverse events attributable to RSV infection or Palivizumab treatment were reported. We conclude that the RSV-related hospitalization rate in this high-risk cohort was comparable to the rate observed in the subgroup of Palivizumab-prophylaxed children with BPD in the IMpact-RSV trial.  2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

464,"Cost of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections in US Infants: Systematic Literature Review and Analysis Background: Limited data are available on the economic costs of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections among infants and young children in the United States. Methods: We performed a systematic literature review of 10 key databases to identify studies published between 1 January 2014 and 2 August 2021 that reported RSV-related costs in US children aged 0-59 months. Costs were extracted and a systematic analysis was performed. Results: Seventeen studies were included. Although an RSV hospitalization (RSVH) of an extremely premature infant costs 5.6 times that of a full-term infant ($10 214), full-term infants accounted for 82% of RSVHs and 70% of RSVH costs. Medicaid-insured infants were 91% more likely than commercially insured infants to be hospitalized for RSV treatment in their first year of life. Medicaid financed 61% of infant RSVHs. Paying 32% less per hospitalization than commercial insurance, Medicaid paid 51% of infant RSVH costs. Infants' RSV treatment costs $709.6 million annually, representing $187 per overall birth and $227 per publicly funded birth. Conclusions: Public sources pay for more than half of infants' RSV medical costs, constituting the highest rate of RSVHs and the highest expenditure per birth. Full-term infants are the predominant source of infant RSVHs and costs.

465,"Assessment of the Effects of Active Immunisation against Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) using Decision-Analytic Models: A Systematic Review with a Focus on Vaccination Strategies, Modelling Methods and Input Data Background: Several vaccine and antibody candidates are currently in development for the prevention of lower respiratory tract infections caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and SCOPUS and included model-based evaluations of RSV vaccinations. Two reviewers performed the selection, data extraction, and quality evaluation with EVIDEM. Cost-effectiveness (CE) estimates were converted to $US purchasing power parity (PPP), year 2018 values. Potential economic and epidemiological outcomes were summarised for maternal, infant, children, and elderly vaccinations. The PROSPERO identifier is CRD42019122570. Results: In total, 22 model-based studies were reviewed. On average, a potential 27% reduction in RSV hospitalisations in infants was projected for maternal vaccination and 50% for direct infant immunisation. The CE of maternal vaccination was $US17665857 PPP 2018/disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (Gavi)-eligible countries. For England, the maximum cost-effective price of maternal vaccination was estimated at $US81.5 PPP 2018. Infant vaccination was associated with higher CE ratios in low- and high-income settings. Vaccination of neonates born before the RSV season was the most cost effective in high-income settings. Higher values for vaccine effectiveness, duration of protection, and vaccine uptake increased the benefits. Due to indirect effects, the vaccination of school-age children and a cocooning strategy were effective alternatives to protect infants, and the vaccination of children aged < 5 years had a beneficial impact on the elderly. Conclusion: RSV vaccines with anticipated characteristics may reduce a sizeable proportion of the RSV burden. The results are subject to uncertainty because of the limited epidemiological and clinical data. Data on RSV incidence and hospitalisation risk for granular age strata should be prioritised to facilitate the evaluation of RSV interventions and decision making.

467,"Palivizumab prophylaxis during nosocomial outbreaks of respiratory syncytial virus in a neonatal intensive care unit: Predicting effectiveness with an artificial neural network model Study Objective: To identify subgroups of premature infants who may benefit from palivizumab prophylaxis during nosocomial outbreaks of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis using an artificial intelligence model. SETTING: Level IIIB, 35-bed, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at a tertiary care hospital in the United Arab Emirates. PATIENTS: One hundred seventy six premature infants, born at a gestational age of 22-34 weeks, and hospitalized during four RSV outbreaks that occurred between April 2005 and July 2007. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We collected demographic and clinical data for each patient by using a standardized form. Input data consisted of seven categoric and continuous variables each. We trained, tested, and validated artificial neural networks for three outcomes of interest: mortality, days of supplemental oxygen, and length of NICU stay after the index case was identified. We compared variable impacts and performed reassignments with live predictions to evaluate the effect of palivizumab. Of the 176 infants, 31 (17.6%) received palivizumab during the outbreaks. All neural network configurations converged within 4 seconds in less than 400 training cycles. Infants who received palivizumab required supplemental oxygen for a shorter duration compared with controls (105.2  7.2 days vs 113.2  10.4 days, p=0.003). This benefit was statistically significant in male infants whose birth weight was less than 0.7 kg and who had hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease. Length of NICU stay after identification of the index case and mortality were independent of palivizumab use. CONCLUSION: Palivizumab may be an effective intervention during nosocomial outbreaks of RSV in a subgroup of extremely low-birth-weight male infants with hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease.  2013 Pharmacotherapy Publications, Inc.

Estimating the influenza-related disease burden is a prerequisite to estimate the costs. Age-specific regression models were used to estimate the number of excess hospitalisations attributable to influenza from influenza and respiratory syncytial virus surveillance data. The number of general practitioner consultations for influenza/influenza-like illness was estimated from a continuous randomly sampled national study of general practice activity. Utilising the associated costs for each of these events, a cost-of-illness study was developed from the perspective of the Australian healthcare system. There was an annual average of 310,000 general practitioner consultations for influenza/influenza-like illness and 18,400 hospitalisations attributable to influenza over the period of review. The estimated cost to the Australian healthcare system for these events was $115 million annually.

470,"Clinical characteristics and direct medical cost of respiratory syncytial virus infection in children hospitalized in Suzhou, China BACKGROUND:: There have been few studies on children hospitalized with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) published from mainland China. We performed a retrospective review of medical charts to describe the epidemiology, clinical features and direct medical cost of laboratory-proven RSV children hospitalized in Suzhou, China. METHODS:: Testing is routine for RSV for children admitted to the respiratory ward at Suzhou University Children's Hospital. We performed a retrospective study on children with documented RSV infection hospitalized at Suzhou University Children Hospital during 2005-2009 using a structured chart review instrument. RESULTS:: A total of 2721 hospitalized children (15.0% of those tested) were positive by immunofluorescent assay for RSV during 2005-2009, and 64.0% of them were male. Eighty-seven percentage of the RSV-infected children were 2 years old and younger, and 56.6% were 6 months of age. The median length of hospital stay was 8 days. Of the RSV-infected children, 92.5% developed pneumonia and 21.8% experienced wheezing. In total, 49 (5.1%) of RSV-positive children were transferred to the ICU. Children 6 months old and who had congenital heart disease had higher risk of severe RSV disease. The mean cost of each RSV-related hospitalization was US$571.8 (US$909.6 for children referred to ICU and US$565.4 for those cared for on the wards). Multivariable logistic regression showed that compared with the 6 months children, those aged >6 months old had higher hospitalization cost; children with respiratory distress or with chronic lung diseases tended to have higher hospitalization costs than others. CONCLUSIONS:: RSV infections and severe RSV diseases mostly occurred in early infancy. The direct medical cost was high relative to family income. Effective strategies of RSV immunization of young children in China may be beneficial in addressing this disease burden.  2013 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

471,"Diagnosis of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infection in children by Respiratory Panel utilized during the COVID-19 pandemic BACKGROUND: In the months of October and November 2021, there was throughout Italy and in our specific case in the area of Lucca and Versilia, a disturbing increase of SARS-CoV-2 infections and cases of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) in new-borns. The aim of this paper is to compare the cases of RSV infection diagnosed in recent years to the cases recorded during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic to November 2022. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study consisted of evaluating the results of requests for RSV diagnosis from 2015 to November 2022, using molecular biology techniques. RESULTS: The data obtained show that the number of cases of RSV infection in children during the winter season had a constant trend from 2015 to 2019. From November 2020 to February 2021 there were no cases of RSV respiratory infections. Starting from September 2021, on the other hand, there was a resumption of cases of RSV infections in conjunction with an increase in the number of children affected by COVID-19. From January 2022, after a peak in cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, there has been a decrease in RSV infections. From September 2022 to November 2022, there was no increase of cases of RSV infections in new-borns but on the contrary, there was a trend in respiratory infections comparable to the pre-pandemic period. CONCLUSION: The data that emerged from the study conducted, show the onset of an outbreak of RSV in new-borns. This incidence is linked to the implementation of rigorous non-pharmacological public health interventions in 2020, aimed at combating COVID-19 infection. The use of the molecular panel made it possible to identifying the responsible agent and highlighting the most suitable clinical and therapeutic path.

473,"Respiratory syncytial virus Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common pathogen of the lower respiratory tract in infants. Groups at risk for severe disease include preterm infants, infants with pulmonary disease such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, infants with congenital heart disease, and infants suffering from immunodeficiency. However, most infants getting severely ill from RSV are otherwise healthy and born at term. The incidence of hospitalisation caused by RSV is increasing, and there is an association between diagnosed RSV infection and subsequent development of wheeze and asthma. No vaccine or causal therapy is available. However, prophylaxis with a humanized monoclonal antibody of murine origin, palivizumab, reduces the risk of hospitalisation in high-risk infants, but the treatment is expensive. The most important prophylaxis methods at the present time are therefore hygienic measures with the purpose of preventing nosocomial infection in hospitals.

Generally, one of the two genotypes (A and B) predominates in a single season and alternate annually with regional variation. RSV is a known cause of disease and death at both extremes of ages in the pediatric and elderly, as well as immunocompromised populations. The clinical impact of RSV on the hospitalized adults has been recently clarified with the expanded use of multiplex molecular assays. Among adults, RSV can produce a wide range of clinical symptoms due to upper respiratory tract infections potentially leading to severe lower respiratory tract infections, as well as exacerbations of underlying cardiac and lung diseases.

475,"Severe respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis in children: From short mechanical ventilation to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation The objective of this study was to describe the characteristics of children who required mechanical ventilation (MV) or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis, and to identify risk factors associated with disease severity assessed by duration of MV, mortality and need for ECMO. Ventilated children under 1 year of age admitted for bronchiolitis were retrospectively studied over the 8-year period 1996-2003. The study population included 151 children. Of these, 38.4% were born prematurely and 8.6% had bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The mean age at initiation of MV was 61 days ( 63 days). Infants were ventilated for a mean of 7.8 days ( 7.5 days). Multivariate analysis revealed that prolonged duration of MV (> 6 days, median value) was significantly associated with low gestational age (P = 0.02 for the group < 32 weeks), requirement of neonatal oxygen supplementation (P = 0.03), BPD (P = 0.02) and positive tracheal aspiration culture (P = 0.004), in particular for Haemophilus influenzae (P = 0.03). Fourteen infants required ECMO with a mean period of MV before ECMO of 3.9 days ( 4.5 days). Amongst these infants, the frequency of BPD was significantly higher as compared with the others (P = 0.001). Four infants died (survival rate 71.4%). The mean duration of ECMO for survivors was 12.1 days ( 3.3 days). Conclusion: The data suggest that gestational age, requirement of neonatal oxygen supplementation, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and tracheal colonisation with Haemophilus influenzae are correlated with prolonged mechanical ventilation in children with bronchiolitis. Only bronchopulmonary dysplasia was associated with a need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation that may provide lifesaving support in infants refractory to conventional management.

The prophylaxis against RSV infection by vaccination has been unsuccessful because of its adverse effects. As antiviral drug, ribavirin spray (aerosol) had been used clinically and reduces the amount of virus load, without reducing the necessity of symptomatic therapy and the duration of hospitalization. Therefore RSV LRI has been treated mainly symptomatically. Recently humanized anti-RSV F protein monoclonal antibody was developed and prescribed for prevention in high-risk infants such as premature ones and those with chronic lung and congenital heart diseases. It reduced the incidence of hospitalization significantly. It has been introduced in clinical use in Japan following to Western countries.

477,"Rapid weight gain in early life is associated with severity of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis in children Objectives: This study aimed to investigate whether rapid weight gain in early life was associated with the severity of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis in children. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 190 patients (1-24 months) hospitalized for RSV bronchiolitis. Parameters of bronchiolitis severity were compared between rapid (change in weight z-score from birth >0.67, n = 65) and normal weight gain groups (n = 125). We assessed for correlations between bronchiolitis severity and weight gain. Linear regression was performed to predict for bronchiolitis severity based on weight gain, controlling for covariates. SPSS was used for statistical analyses. Results: The rapid weight gain group had longer mean durations of tachypnea (2.32.0 vs. 1.71.8 days, P = 0.027), wheezing (3.22.5 vs. 1.61.8 days, P < 0.001), and chest retractions (1.52.2 vs. 0.61.3 days, P = 0.007). Correlations of weight gain with tachypnea (r = 0.146), wheezing (r = 0.279), and chest retractions (r = 0.179) were statistically significant. Weight gain predicted for tachypnea (B = 0.485, P = 0.013) and wheezing (B = 0.846, P = 0.001) durations after adjusting for covariates of severity (age, sex, current weight, RSV type, coinfection, recurrent bronchiolitis, hospital stay, fever, oxygen supplementation, maximal respiratory and heart rates, and laboratory indices). Conclusions: Our findings suggest an association between weight gain and severity of RSV bronchiolitis in young children. Weight gain was significantly associated with the durations of tachypnea and wheezing. The trajectory of weight gain in early life may play a significant role in the clinical course of RSV bronchiolitis.

478,"Immunoglobulin for preventing respiratory syncytial virus infection. BACKGROUND: Respiratory Syncytial virus, the most important cause of lower respiratory tract infections in infants and young children in industrialized countries, is associated with increased morbidity in premature infants with or without bronchopulmonary dysplasia as well as those with congenital heart disease. Because of observations that lower rates of disease occur immediately after birth, presumably due to vertical transmission of maternal antibody, and animal studies where protection from pneumonia was observed through administration of immune globulin, the efficacy of passive prophylaxis in premature infants has been studied. OBJECTIVES: This meta-analysis was performed to assess the effects of polyclonal respiratory syncytial virus hyperimmune globulin or monoclonal antibody in preventing RSV hospitalization, receipt of intensive care, mechanical ventilation, and mortality in those with underlying prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or congenital heart disease. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections trials register and MEDLINE in March, 1999. In addition, abstracts on these topics were sought from the Pediatric Academies Meetings and the Intersciences Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy for the years 1994 to 1997, inclusive. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized, controlled trials of prevention of RSV using immune globulin, respiratory syncytial virus immune globulin, or monoclonal RSV antibody in children with prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia or congenital heart disease. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently abstracted data and assessed study quality. Only incidences could be pooled because data for durations was summarized in a manner that did not allow combining results across the studies. MAIN RESULTS: Four studies with a total of 2598 subjects were included in the main analysis. All were randomized controlled trials. Two trials were not blinded. Three studies examined RSV hyperimmune globulin and one examined monoclonal RSV antibody. A study of a different monoclonal RSV antibody could not be included because it has not been presented or published. The pooled Peto Odds Ratios favoring prophylaxis were 0.48 (95% CI 0.37, 0.64), 0.47 (0.29, 0. 77), and 0.99 (0.48, 2.07) for incidence of hospitalization, incidence of ICU admission, and incidence of mechanical ventilation, respectively. The numbers needed to prevent one hospitalization and one ICU admission are 17 and 50 respectively. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: RSVIG is effective in preventing RSV hospitalizations and admission to the intensive care unit, but not in preventing mechanical ventilation. There was a non-significant trend towards a higher mortality in children given RSVIG. (Wang E.E.; Tang N.K.)

From 20 January to 31 March 2003 a total of 123 subjects with upper respiratory tract infection attended Yunus Emre Health Center. Ninety-one subjects fit the case definition of influenza-like illness, which consisted of acute fever of more than 38C, cough, and sore throat. After obtaining their consent, nasal swabs were taken for isolation of influenza and RSV. Of these, 10 were influenza A virus, 6 were influenza B virus and 20 were RSV. All of influenza virus A was typed as subtype H3N2. The rates of influenza virus among 5-9 and 1-4 years of age groups and of RSV among 1-4 years of age group were high. The average number of absentee days of schoolchildren with influenza was 3.33 days and of those with RSV infection was 1.43 days; this rate was calculated as 2.25 days for the influenza-like illness. Continuous surveillance and influenza vaccination for target groups are recommended for beneficial effects of reducing influenza morbidity and mortality in the community. (Akin L.; Surlu B.)

480,"A 4 year prospective study to determine risk factors for severe community acquired pneumonia in children in southern China Background Pneumonia is the major cause of death under 5 years. With high CAP numbers in China and growing access to PICUs, factors associated with severe CAP need to be determined to optimize care. Objective To prospectively determine PICU CAP admission features and outcomes. Methods A 4 year prospective study of CAP aged 1 month to <14 years admitted to PICU, Children's Hospital Affiliated to Soochow University, China. All were managed in a standard manner. Clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings were collected systematically. All received antibiotics. Results Eight hundred ten (7%) of 10,836 CAP hospital admissions needed PICU. Seven hundred seven (87%) were enrolled. PICU CAP children were young (76%  12 months) and 33% had co-morbid conditions; 21% congenital heart disease.21% required mechanical ventilation. The average length of PICU stay was 5 days (range, 3-27). The case fatality rate was 5.8%. Viruses were detected in 38%, RSV 24%; bacteria in 23%, Streptococcus pneumoniae 7%, Haemophilus influenza b 4%, Mycoplasma 11%. On single factor analysis, PICU admission respiratory rate >70/min, grunting/groaning, head nodding, cyanosis, and anemia were associated with respiratory failure and with fatality. On multivariate analysis only presence of congenital heart disease, Trisomy 21 and immunodeficiency correlated with fatality; not microbe nor PICU findings. Conclusions Young age and underlying congenital heart disease were associated factors for PICU support in CAP in China. Early referral if altered sensorium, high respiratory rate, head nodding, grunting and anemia, and universal access to conjugated vaccines may decrease morbidity and mortality.  2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

481,"Respiratory syncytial virus immunisation overview Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) continues to be a significant source of morbidity and mortality in both adults and children. Natural infection confers incomplete protection, permitting recurrent episodes. Treatment remains limited to supportive care. Initial endeavours to develop a vaccine resulted in an unexpected enhancement of RSV disease and increased recipient mortality. Current proposed strategies to prevent RSV infection rely on the principles of active and passive immunisation and utilise the highly conserved RSV F-protein. Maternal vaccines administered in pregnancy may provide protection; trials are ongoing. Palivizumab, a monoclonal antibody, has a moderate preventative efficacy. A similar newer longer lasting formulation appears promising. A number of other novel options are being developed and are undergoing assessment. Progress has been made, with more vaccine candidates under consideration. We are edging closer to an effective solution to prevent RSV infection. If successful, the impact on paediatric morbidity, mortality, workload and cost will be substantial.

482,"Respiratory Syncytial Virus Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a ubiquitous virus and infects nearly every child before their second birthday. Caus-ing a wide array of symptoms, ranging from a mild cold to respiratory failure and even death, it is an illness that every general pediatrician will encoun-ter on a yearly basis. It is important to know which populations are at risk for severe disease and what we can do to protect them from RSV and treat them if they do contract it. Many preventive measures are being studied, but so far, RSV has proved a challenging virus to capture and control. As our technology and knowledge grow, there is hope for a vaccine, more attainable and longer-lasting immunoprophylaxis, and better treatment options for those who do contract the disease.

483,"The burden of influenza in England by age and clinical risk group: A statistical analysis to inform vaccine policy Objectives: To assess the burden of influenza by age and clinical status and use this to inform evaluations of the age and risk-based influenza vaccination policy in the United Kingdom. Methods: Weekly laboratory reports for influenza and 7 other respiratory pathogens were extracted from the national database and used in a regression model to estimate the proportion of acute respiratory illness outcomes attributable to each pathogen. Results: Influenza accounted for ~10% of the attributed respiratory admissions and deaths in hospital. Healthy children under five had the highest influenza admission rate (1.9/1000). The presence of co-morbidities increased the admission rate by 5.7 fold for 5-14 year olds (from 0.1 to 0.56/1000), the relative risk declining to 1.8 fold in 65+ year olds (from 0.46 to 0.84/1000). The majority (72%) of influenza-attributable deaths in hospital occurred in 65+ year olds with co-morbidities. Mortality in children under 15 years was low with around 12 influenza-attributable deaths in hospital per year in England the case fatality rate was substantially higher in risk than non-risk children. Infants under 6 months had the highest consultation and admission rates, around 70/1000 and 3/1000 respectively. Conclusions: Additional strategies are needed to reduce the remaining morbidity and mortality in the high-risk and elderly populations, and to protect healthy children currently not offered the benefits of vaccination.  2014 The Authors.

484,"Severity and mortality of respiratory syncytial virus vs influenza A infection in hospitalized adults in China Background : Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an important cause of medically attended acute respiratory illnesses in older adults but awareness of the relevance of RSV in older people remains lower than that of influenza, which exhibits similar clinical characteristics to those of RSV. Objectives: This study was performed to assess the clinical significance of RSV in respiratory samples from hospitalized adults. Methods: Characteristics and outcomes in adults (18 years) hospitalized for RSV infection (n = 51) were compared with a cohort hospitalized for influenza A infection (n = 279) in a single-center retrospective cohort study in Beijing, China. Results: Respiratory syncytial virus patients were slightly older, with no significant differences in underlying chronic conditions. Lower respiratory tract infection and cardiovascular complications were more frequent (P <.05) in RSV patients. Rates of mortality in the RSV cohorts were significantly higher within 30 days (13.7% vs 5.0%, P =.019) and 60 days (17.6% vs 7.5%, P =.021). Bacterial co-infection in respiratory samples was associated with reduced survival among RSV patients (log rank, P =.013). Conclusions: Respiratory syncytial virus is a common cause of serious illness among hospitalized adults in China with greater mortality than influenza A. Increased awareness and the availability of antiviral agents might increase the scope for successful management.

485,"Describing global pediatric RSV disease at intensive care units in GAVI-eligible countries using molecular point-of-care diagnostics: the RSV GOLD-III study protocol Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is an important cause of hospitalization and death in young children. The majority of deaths (99%) occur in low- and lower-middle-income countries (LMICs). Vaccines against RSV infection are underway. To obtain access to RSV interventions, LMICs depend on support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. To identify future vaccine target populations, information on children with severe RSV infection is required. However, there is a lack of individual patient-level clinical data on instances of life-threatening RSV infection in LMICs. The RSV GOLD IIIICU Network study aims to describe clinical, demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of children with life-threatening RSV infection in Gavi-eligible countries. Methods: The RSV GOLD-IIIICU Network study is an international, prospective, observational multicenter study and will be conducted in 10 Gavi-eligible countries at pediatric intensive care units and high-dependency units (PICUs/HDUs) during local viral respiratory seasons for 2 years. Children younger than 2 years of age with respiratory symptoms fulfilling the World Health Organization (WHO) extended severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) case definition will be tested for RSV using a molecular point-of-care (POC) diagnostic device. Patient characteristics will be collected through a questionnaire. Mortality rates of children admitted to the PICU and/or HDU will be calculated. Discussion: This multicenter descriptive study will provide a better understanding of the characteristics and mortality rates of children younger than 2 years with RSV infection admitted to the PICU/HDU in LMICs. These results will contribute to knowledge on global disease burden and awareness of RSV and will directly guide decision makers in their efforts to implement future RSV prevention strategies.

This study was to establish a model to explore anti- RSV effect of different administration method of Chinese medicine realgar on respiratory syncytial virus type A (RSV-A) replication in Hep-2 cells. Using high-energy ball milling with distilled water to prepare realgar nanoparticles,the concentration of nanometer realgar was tested by molybdenum blue staining method and the size of realgar nanoparticles was tested on Nano Series. Cell culture with ribavirin as a positive control was applied to observe the effect of anti-respiratory syncytial virus type A replication through prevention, treatment or direct inactivation of three different drug administration methods. Realgar nano-particles was found to be a potential inhibitor of RSV-A in a concentration-dependent manner with the median toxic concentration(TC50) of 0.649 microg/mL in Hep-2 cell culture. The median inhibition concentration (IC50) was 0.20 microg/mL when drug was added before virus infection. The IC50 was 0.13 microg/mL when drug was added after virus infection,and it was 0.16 microg/mL when the drug was mixed with virus and added. The therapeutic index (TI) was 3.18, 4.99 and 4.11, respectively. The results showed realgar nanoparticles could inhibit the replication of the RSV and inactivate the RSV in vitro. (Cheng M.)

Infants receiving 1 dose of palivizumab during the 2006- 2011 respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) seasons were recruited across 30 sites. Respiratory illness events were captured monthly. Infants 32 completed weeks gestational age (GA) (Group 1) were compared to 33-35 completed weeks GA infants (Group 2) following prophylaxis. In total, 6,654 patients were analyzed (Group 1, n=5,183; Group 2, n=1,471). The mean GA was 29.92.9 versus 34.22.2 weeks for Groups 1 and 2, respectively. Group differences were significant (all p-values <0.05) for the following: proportion of males, Caucasians, siblings, multiple births, maternal smoking, smoking during pregnancy, household smokers, >5 household individuals, birth weight, and enrolment age. Overall, infants received 92.6 % of expected injections. Group 1 received significantly more injections, but a greater proportion of Group 2 received injections within recommended intervals. The hospitalization rates were similar for Groups 1 and 2 for respiratory illness (4.7 % vs. 3.7 %, p=0.1) and RSV (1.5 % vs. 1.4 %, p=0.3). Neither the time to first respiratory illness [hazard ratio00.9, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.7-1.2, p=0.5] nor to first RSV hospitalization (hazard ratio01.3, 95 % CI 0.8-2.2, p=0.3) were different.

488,"Severe Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection in Hospitalized Children Background: Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) are one of the most common causes of death worldwide. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of LRTI in children. Despite of its epidemiological importance, there is limited information regarding the impact of this virus in Latin America. Aims of the study: We carried out a prospective study to establish the frequency and characteristics of RSV infections in hospitalized Mexican children. Methods: 1,252 children hospitalized between November, 2012 and December, 2015 because of LRTI were included in the study. A respiratory sample was obtained for RSV detection by RT-PCR and information regarding clinical presentation, hospital course, and outcome was recorded. Results: RSV was detected in 43.7% of children admitted with LRTI, in 43.3% of those admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), and in 36.4% of those who died. Infants with RSV infection were younger, were diagnosed with bronchiolitis more frequently, and were less likely to have underlying disorders than those with RSV-negative LRTI. Among RSV-positive infants, admission to the ICU was associated with the presence of underlying conditions, pneumonia diagnosis, and young age. Four (0.73%) of the 547 infants with RSV infection died; death was more common in those with underlying disorders than previously healthy infants (3.8 vs. 0.2%, respectively; p = 0.02). Conclusion: RSV contributes to a large proportion of LRTI hospital admissions. Most children admitted with RSV infection do not have underlying conditions. However, severe infection requiring ICU admission and death are more common in those with underlying disorders. (Gonzalez-Ortiz A.M.; Vega-Morua M.)

489,"Factors Predicting Secondary Respiratory Morbidity Following Early-Life Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections: Population-Based Cohort Study Background: The association between early-life respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections and later respiratory morbidity is well established. However, there is limited evidence on factors that influence this risk. We examined sociodemographic and perinatal factors associated with later childhood respiratory morbidity requiring secondary care following exposure to a laboratory-confirmed RSV episode in the first 2 years. Methods: We used a probabilistically linked whole-of-population-based birth cohort including 252 287 children born in Western Australia between 2000 and 2009 with follow-up to the end of 2012. Cox proportional hazards models estimated adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) of the association of various risk factors with the first respiratory episode for asthma, wheezing, and unspecified acute lower respiratory infection beyond the age of 2 years. Results: The analytic cohort included 4151 children with a confirmed RSV test before age 2 years. The incidence of subsequent respiratory morbidity following early-life RSV infection decreased with child age at outcome (highest incidence in 2-<4-year-olds: 41.8 per 1000 child-years; 95% CI, 37.5-46.6), increased with age at RSV infection (6-<12-month-olds: 23.6/1000 child-years; 95% CI, 19.9-27.8; 12-<24-month-olds: 22.4/1000 child-years; 95% CI, 18.2-22.7) and decreasing gestational age (50.8/1000 child-years; 95% CI, 33.5-77.2 for children born extremely preterm, <28 weeks gestation). Risk factors included age at first RSV episode (6-<12 months: aHR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.06-1.90), extreme prematurity (<28 weeks: aHR, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.40-3.53), maternal history of asthma (aHR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.04-1.70), and low socioeconomic index (aHR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.03-3.00). Conclusions: Our results suggest that in addition to preterm and young infants, children aged 12-<24 months could also be potential target groups for RSV prevention to reduce the burden of later respiratory morbidities associated with RSV.

A birth cohort of 635 children in Kilifi, Kenya, was monitored for respiratory syncytial virus infections from January 31, 2002, to April 22, 2005. Predictors of infection were examined by Cox regression and disease risk by binomial regression. A total of 598 respiratory syncytial virus infections were identified (411 primary, 187 repeat), with 409 determined by antigen assay and 189 by antibody alone (using a ""most pragmatic"" serologic definition). The incidence decreased by 70 following a primary infection (adjusted hazard ratio 0.30, 95 confidence interval: 0.21, 0.42; P < 0.001) and by 59 following a secondary infection (hazard ratio 0.41, 95 confidence interval: 0.22, 0.73; P 0.003), for a period lasting 6 months. Relative to the age group <6 months, all ages exhibited a higher incidence of infection.

On March 23, the index patient (neonate A), aged 3 days, had feeding intolerance and apnea. A nasopharyngeal swab specimen collected from neonate A was tested using a single-manufacturer rapid RSV antigen detection test (RRADT) at the hospital laboratory; the result was positive. The following day, because of concern about the possibility of more widespread RSV infection, RRADT was used to test nasopharyngeal swab specimens from neonate B, aged 1 month, who had resided in a different hospital room in the NICU and had developed an increased oxygen requirement, apnea, and poor feeding that day, as well as from two asymptomatic neonates who were hospitalized in the same room with neonate A; all three were positive. Later that day, nasopharyngeal swab specimens from the remaining 16 asymptomatic NICU patients were tested using the same RRADT; seven tests were positive, making a total of 11 positives.

This phase 1b study evaluated the pharmacokinetics, safety, and antiviral effects of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)specific fusion inhibitor JNJ-53718678 (JNJ-8678) in hospitalized RSV-infected patients aged > 1 to 24 months. Methods. Patients categorized by age (cohort 1: 6 to 24 months; cohort 2: 3 to < 6 months; cohort 3: > 1 to < 3 months) were randomized to oral JNJ-8678 or placebo once daily for 7 days. Dose increases followed data review committee recommendations (cohort 1: 2/6/8/9 mg/kg; cohort 2: 1.5/4.5/6 mg/kg; cohort 3: 1/3/5 mg/kg). Cohort 1 included a 9 mg/kg dose, as target exposures were not reached at lower doses. Sparse pharmacokinetic samples were assessed using population pharmacokinetics modeling. Safety was assessed by adverse events (AEs), laboratory tests, and electrocardiograms. To assess antiviral effects, RSV RNA viral load from nasal swabs was quantified over time using reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Results. Patients received JNJ-8678 (n = 37) or placebo (n = 7). Pharmacokinetic parameters were similar at the highest doses for cohorts 13 (area under the plasma concentrationtime curve from time of administration up to 24 hours postdosing at day 7: 35 840, 34 980, and 39 627 ng  hour/mL, respectively). Two grade 3 AEs were reported (both bronchiolitis; 1 JNJ-8678, 1 placebo), reported as serious AEs; all other AEs were grade 1 or 2. Two additional serious AEs were reported (rhinitis [JNJ-8678]; pneumonia [placebo]). No deaths, grade 4 AEs, or AEs leading to discontinuation were reported. Median RSV viral load change from baseline in JNJ-8678 vs placebo by day 3 was 1.98 vs 0.32 log(10) copies/mL. Conclusions. In RSV-infected infants, JNJ-8678 was well tolerated. Target exposures were reached and antiviral activity was observed.

494,"Comparison of the cost of hospitalization for respiratory syncytial virus disease versus palivizumab prophylaxis in canadian inuit infants BACKGROUND: The objectives were to compare actual respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) hospitalization rates and costs in a cohort of Inuit infants to hypothetical palivizumab prophylaxis strategies for infants of all gestational ages in the Eastern Canadian Arctic. METHODS: Incidence and costs of RSV hospitalization were collected for infants admitted to the Baffin Regional Hospital in 2002, before the initiation of palivizumab. There was a comparison of the actual costs to the costs associated with 8 palivizumab strategies stratified by age (<6 months, <1 year) and location (overall, town [Iqaluit], rural communities). It was assumed that each category would receive universal palivizumab prophylaxis resulting in a 78% decrease in RSV admissions. The net costs incurred, number needed to treat (NNT), and incremental costs per hospitalization avoided were calculated for each comparison. RESULTS: There was a great variation in the rates and costs associated with RSV admissions between Iqaluit and the communities. For infants <1 year of age residing in Iqaluit, the mean admission cost was $3915, and palivizumab prophylaxis had an NNT of 20.4 and cost of $162,551 per admission avoided. For rural infants <6 months, the mean cost of admission was $23,030, and palivizumab prophylaxis resulted in an NNT of 3.9 to 2.5 and cost savings of up to $8118 per admission avoided. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the high rates and costs associated with RSV admissions, administration of palivizumab in rural communities in the Canadian Arctic to infants less than 6 months of age could result in net cost savings.

495,"Comparative costs of hospitalisation among infants at high risk for respiratory syncytial virus lower respiratory tract infection during the first year of life Objective: This retrospective cohort study compared the total cost of hospitalisation due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract infection (LRI) during the first year of life between late-preterm (33-36 weeks gestational age [wGA]) and term (37 wGA) infants. Research design and methods: A large national claims database of commercially insured members was examined to identify hospital admissions associated with RSV between January 2003 and June 2007 among infants at high risk for RSV LRI, including late-preterm infants. Hospital use and costs were compared with those of a reference cohort of term infants with RSV. Results: The cost of hospitalisation for RSV among late-preterm infants with at least one hospital admission associated with RSV (n=173) was twice that of term infants (n=1,983; $20,269 vs. 9,635; p<0.001). The mean length of stay was also higher (5.3 vs. 3.4 days; p<0.001). Approximately 21.9% of hospitalisations for late-preterm infants included an intensive care unit admission compared with 9.6% among term infants (p<0.001). Limitations: Reliance on ICD-9 codes to identify potential cohort members may result in misclassification and underreporting the cohort size for conditions of interest. Conclusions: Hospitalisation costs and length of stay due to RSV LRI were significantly greater among late-preterm infants compared with term infants and higher than general estimates previously reported in the broader paediatric population.  2010 Informa UK Ltd.

496,"Cost of hospitalization for respiratory syncytial virus chest infection and implications for passive immunization strategies in a developing nation Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) chest infection is a common cause of hospitalization in the very young child. The aim of this study was to determine the direct cost of resource utilization in the treatment of children hospitalized with RSV chest infection and the potential cost-savings with passive immunization for high-risk infants. An audit of the hospital resource consumption and its costs was performed for 216 children aged <24 mo admitted with RSV chest infection between 1995 and 1997. The cost-saving potential of passive immunization using monoclonal RSV antibodies during the RSV season was determined by assuming an 0.55 efficacy in hospitalization reduction when administered to ""high-risk"" infants according to the guidelines outlined by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). The hospital treatment cost of 1064 bed-days amounted to USD 64 277.70. Each child occupied a median of 4.0 bed-days at a median cost of USD 169.99 (IQ1 128.08, 1Q3 248.47). Children, who were ex-premature or with an underlying illness were more likely to have a longer hospital stay, higher treatment costs and need for intensive care. Ten (42%) of 24 ex-premature infants fulfilled the recommended criteria for passive immunization. Its use resulted in an incremental cost of USD 31.39 to a potential cost saving of USD 0.91 per infant for each hospital day saved. Conclusion: Ex-prematurity and the presence of an underlying illness results in escalation of the direct treatment cost of RSV chest infection. Current guidelines for use of passive RSV immunization do not appear to be cost-effective if adopted for Malaysian infants. (Chan P.W.-K., patrick@ummc.edu.my; Abdel-Latif M.E.-A.)

497,"A comparison of characteristics and outcomes in severe human metapneumovirus and respiratory syncytial virus infections in children treated in an intensive care unit Background: Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are among the leading causes of respiratory tract infections requiring admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). We evaluated the risk factors, clinical courses and outcomes of severe HMPV disease relative to severe RSV in children admitted to the PICU. Methods: Retrospective chart review of children.18 years old admitted to a tertiary PICU between October 2008 through July 2010 with acute respiratory tract infection and positive direct antigen stain or polymerase chain reaction for RSV or HMPV. Results: One hundred thirty-three patients met inclusion criteria: 107 (80.5%) with RSV and 26 (19.5%) with HMPV. HMPV-infected patients were older than RSV children (3.4 vs. 1.5 years, P = 0.002) and more likely to have congenital heart disease (34.6% vs. 10.3%, P = 0.002). Although HMPV children required longer duration of mechanical ventilation (11 vs. 7 days, P = 0.01), there were no other differences in hospital course. HMPV patients were more likely to be discharged receiving inhaled steroids (53.8% vs. 30.8%, P = 0.03), but there were no differences in other outcome assessments. Conclusions: Children admitted to the PICU with HMPV are significantly older and more likely to have congenital heart disease than those with RSV.

498,"Respiratory syncytial virus infections Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the most common respiratory pathogens in infants and young children worldwide. Almost all children are infected at least once by the age of 2 years. The clinical manifestations vary depending on age, health status, and whether the infection is primary or secondary. Most RSV-infected children experience upper respiratory tract symptoms and 20% to 30% develop lower respiratory tract disease (e.g., bronchiolitis and/or pneumonia). RSV is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infection in children younger than 1 year. Most children who have been previously healthy have mild lower respiratory tract infections. However, prematurity, chronic lung disease, congenital heart disease, and primary or secondary immune deficiencies are risk factors for severe RSV infections. Diagnosis can often be clinical. Diagnostic testing is not routinely recommended. The treatment of upper and lower respiratory tract infections is generally supportive. Ribavirin can be used in patients with immune deficiency but is not routinely recommended. There is not a routine vaccine for RSV. The RSV-specific humanized mouse monoclonal antibody ""palivizumab"" is particularly safe and effective for prophylaxis in high-risk groups. (Dayar G.T., drgulperi@hotmail.com; Kocabas E.)

499,"Optimal Respiratory Syncytial Virus intervention programmes using Nirsevimab in England and Wales Introduction: Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is a major cause of acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRI) in infants. There are no licensed vaccines and only one monoclonal antibody available to protect infants from disease. A new and potentially longer-lasting monoclonal antibody, Nirsevimab, showed promising results in phase IIb/III trials. We evaluate the cost-effectiveness of Nirsevimab intervention programmes in England and Wales. Methods: We used a dynamic model for RSV transmission, calibrated to data from England and Wales. We considered a suite of potential Nirsevimab programmes, including administration to all neonates (year-round); only neonates born during the RSV season (seasonal); or neonates born during the RSV season plus infants less than six months old before the start of the RSV season (seasonal + catch-up). Results: If administered seasonally to all infants at birth, we found that Nirsevimab would have to be priced at 63 or less per dose for at least 50% certainty that it could cost-effectively replace the current Palivizumab programme, using an ICER threshold of 20,000/QALY. An extended seasonal programme which includes a pre-season catch-up becomes the optimal strategy at a purchasing price of 32/dose or less for at least 50% certainty. At a purchasing price per dose of 5-32, the annual implementation costs of a seasonal programme could be as high as 2 million before a switch to a year-round strategy would be optimal. Discussion: Nirsevimab has the potential to be cost-effective in England and Wales not only for use in high-risk infants.

500,"Impact of the Withdrawal of Palivizumab Immunoprophylaxis on the Incidence of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Hospitalizations among Infants Born at 33 to 35 Weeks' Gestational Age in the Province of Quebec, Canada: The RSV-Quebec Study Background: Infants born at 33-35 completed weeks' gestational age (wGA) aged <6 months at the start of or born during respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) season and classified as moderate/high risk of severe RSV disease were included in a palivizumab RSV prophylaxis program in the province of Quebec, Canada, until 2014-2015. We assessed the impact of withdrawal of this indication on lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI)/RSV hospitalizations (H) in this population. Methods: We conducted a 4-year, retrospective, cohort study in 25 Quebec hospitals (2 seasons with and 2 without palivizumab prophylaxis for moderate- to high-risk infants). Our primary outcome was LRTI/RSV-H incidence. We compared LRTI/RSV-H incidence before (2013-2015; seasons 1 + 2 [S1/2]) and after (2015-2017; S3/4) the change in indication. Results: We identified 6457 33-35 wGA births. LRTI/RSV-H occurred in 105/3353 infants (3.13%) in S1/2 and 130/3104 (4.19%) in S3/4. Among LRTI/RSV-H, 86.4% were laboratory-confirmed RSV-H. Adjusting for sex, wGA, and birth month, S3/4 was significantly associated with increased LRTI/RSV-H incidence (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.76) but not with laboratory-confirmed RSV-H (aOR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.90-1.58). Mean duration of LRTI/RSV-H was 5.6 days; 22.6% required intensive care unit admission. Comparing S3/4 with S1/2, infant percentage with LRTI/RSV-H classified as moderate/high risk increased from 27.8% to 41.9% (P =. 11). Conclusions: In a province-wide study, we observed a significant increase in LRTI/RSV-H incidence among infants born at 33-35 wGA in the 2 years after withdrawal of RSV prophylaxis.

501,"Sepsis predisposition in children with human immunodeficiency virus Objective: To review predisposition to sepsis in children infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Design: Summary of the literature with review by experts in the field. Results: In industrialized regions, new diagnoses of vertically acquired HIV infection are falling due to perinatal interventions. Provision of HAART has resulted in an enlarging cohort of clinically stable HIV-infected children, with low viral loads and normal CD4 T-lymphocyte counts. Access to HAART in ""developed"" countries has markedly decreased the rate of progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, the prevalence of organ-specific complications of HIV, the risk of recurrent sepsis, and the high early childhood mortality from HIV infection. There are currently no data on whether initiation of HAART during acute sepsis reduces short-term morbidity or mortality. Undiagnosed, antiretroviral-naive, HIV-infected infants still present sporadically with opportunistic infections such as Pneumocystis jiroveci and cytomegalovirus pneumonia. HIV-infected children have a greater burden of disease due to viral, bacterial, and fungal sepsis, and the case fatality rate for nonopportunistic infections may be greater than in non-HIV-infected children. In ""developing"" countries, with limited access to HAART, the natural history of HIV infection has altered very little, with the majority of infected children dying from either opportunistic or nonopportunistic disease before 3 yrs of age. Conclusion: Pediatric HIV infection is not a homogeneous condition in the era of HAART. Susceptibility to sepsis, morbidity, and mortality differ according to stage of disease, access to HAART, and virologic and immunologic response to treatment. These issues should be considered if HIV-infected children are to be enrolled and stratified in clinical trials.

503,"The 2018 annual cost burden for children under five years of age hospitalised with respiratory syncytial virus in Australia Abstract: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the principal causes of acute bronchiolitis and respiratory tract infections in young children. Routine RSV surveillance in Australian children is limited; vaccines are in late stage development; prophylactic monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment is available but expensive; and there has been uncertainty around the cost burden. The objective of this study was to determine the annual cost burden for children under five years of age hospitalised with RSV in a single health service in 2018, with national extrapolation based on published Australian prevalence data. The methods utilised individual patient-level cost data prospectively collected for hospitalised children under five years of age in a tertiary Melbourne paediatric hospital. Results were extrapolated to all Australian children under five years of age to determine the national annual health cost burden, from a healthcare sector perspective over a 12 month time horizon. The results included 363 children with a mean age of 9.2 months (standard deviation, SD: 8.5 months). The mean cost per child was $17,120 (SD: $37,562), with a combined health service cost of $6,214,439. The reported Australian hospitalisation rate for RSV in the target age group ranged from 2.2 to 4.5 per 1,000 children under five years of age, resulting in a 2018 extrapolated cost range of $59,218,844-$121,129,453 for the estimated 3,459-7,075 children affected (combined index and all-cause six-month readmissions). This study concluded that RSV represents a significant cost burden to Australia's health care system. These data are important for future health economic assessments of preventative therapies, such as new RSV mAb treatments and maternal/childhood RSV vaccines, and provides valuable insights to inform health care planning and health policy.

504,"Baicalin from Scutellaria baicalensis blocks respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection and reduces inflammatory cell infiltration and lung injury in mice The roots of Scutellaria baicalensis has been used as a remedy for inflammatory and infective diseases for thousands of years. We evaluated the antiviral activity against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, the leading cause of childhood infection and hospitalization. By fractionation and chromatographic analysis, we determined that baicalin was responsible for the antiviral activity of S. baicalensis against RSV infection. The concentration for 50% inhibition (IC50) of RSV infection was determined at 19.9  1.8 M, while the 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) was measured at 370  10 M. We then used a mouse model of RSV infection to further demonstrate baicalin antiviral effect. RSV infection caused significant lung injury and proinflammatory response, including CD4 and CD8 T lymphocyte infiltration. Baicalin treatment resulted in reduction of T lymphocyte infiltration and gene expression of proinflammatory factors, while the treatment moderately reduced RSV titers recovered from the lung tissues. T lymphocyte infiltration and cytotoxic T lymphocyte modulated tissue damage has been identified critical factors of RSV disease. The study therefore demonstrates that baicalin subjugates RSV disease through antiviral and anti-inflammatory effect. (Shi H.; Ren K.; Lv B.; Zhao Y.; Tan R.X.; Li E.)

505,"Using urine metabolomics to understand the pathogenesis of infant respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection and its role in childhood wheezing Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in infants causes significant morbidity and is the strongest risk factor associated with asthma. Metabolites, which reflect the interactions between host cell and virus, provide an opportunity to identify the pathways that underlie severe infections and asthma development. Objective: To study metabolic profile differences between infants with RSV infection, and human rhinovirus (HRV) infection, and healthy infants. To compare infant metabolic differences between children who do and do not wheeze. Methods: In a term birth cohort, urine was collected while healthy and during acute viral respiratory infection with RSV and HRV. We used (1)H-NMR to identify urinary metabolites. Multivariate and univariate statistics were used to discriminate metabolic profiles of infants with either RSV ARI, or HRV ARI, and healthy infants. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the association of urine metabolites with 1st-, 2nd-, and 3rd-year recurrent wheezing. Results: Several metabolites in nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism pathways were down-regulated in infants with RSV infection compared to healthy controls. There were no significant differences in metabolite profiles between infants with RSV infection and infants with HRV Infection. Alanine was strongly associated with reduced risk of 1st-year wheezing (OR 0.18[0.0, 0.46]) and 2nd-year wheezing (OR 0.31[0.13, 0.73]), while 2-hydroxyisobutyric acid was associated with increased 3rd-year wheezing (OR 5.02[1.49, 16.93]) only among the RSV infected subset. Conclusion: The metabolites associated with infant RSV infection and recurrent-wheezing are indicative of viral takeover of the cellular machinery and resources to enhance virulence, replication, and subversion of the host immune-response, highlighting metabolic pathways important in the pathogenesis of RSV infection and wheeze development.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia among infants and children. The purpose of this paper is to review the epidemiology, etiology, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, risk factors, and assessment of RSV infection in infants and young children. There is a lack of consensus regarding the optimal treatment for children with RSV infection. Bronchodilators, racemic epinephrine, inhaled and systemic corticosteroids, RSV-immunoglobulin (RSV-IG), and ribavirin have all been used for treatment of children with RSV infection. A review of current research indicates supportive and symptomatic management should be the mainstay of treatment. Ultimately, prevention of infection through education and immunotherapy is the key to reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with RSV bronchiolitis. (Cooper A.C.; Banasiak N.C.; Allen P.J.)

507,"Assessing Variation in the Cost of Palivizumab for Respiratory Syncytial Virus Prevention in Preterm Infants Background: The variability in cost of palivizumab treatment, indicated for prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections in high-risk infants, has not been robustly estimated in prior studies. This study aimed to determine the cost variations of palivizumab from a US payer perspective for otherwise healthy preterm infants born 2935 weeks gestational age (wGA) using infant characteristics and applied dosing regimens. Methods: Fenton Growth Charts were merged with World Health Organization Child Growth Standards to estimate preterm infant growth patterns. The merged growth chart was applied to infants who received palivizumab from a prospective, observational registry to determine future body weight using each infants wGA and birth weight. Using quarter 3 (Q3) 2016Q2 2017 vial cost, treatment costs at monthly dosing intervals were estimated using expected weights and averaged by age to derive expected mean 20162017 RSV seasonal costs per infant under various dosing scenarios. Results: Given different dosing scenarios (two to five doses), birth month, and growth patterns for preterm infants 2935 wGA, the estimated average 20162017 seasonal cost of palivizumab treatment ranged from $3221 to $12,568. Outpatient-only cost (excluding first dose at hospital discharge) ranged from $1733 to $11,862. The main drivers of costs were dosing regimen (74% of variance), dosing interacted with birth month (17%), and wGA (6%). Conclusion: The considerable variability in the average cost of palivizumab treatment for preterm infants is driven by choice of dosing regimen, wGA, and birth month. Therefore, when estimating the cost of palivizumab, it is important to consider both infant characteristics at each dose and potential dosing regimens.

508,"WITHDRAWN: Immunoglobulin for preventing respiratory syncytial virus infection. BACKGROUND: Respiratory Syncytial virus, the most important cause of lower respiratory tract infections in infants and young children in industrialized countries, is associated with increased morbidity in premature infants with or without bronchopulmonary dysplasia as well as those with congenital heart disease. Because of observations that lower rates of disease occur immediately after birth, presumably due to vertical transmission of maternal antibody, and animal studies where protection from pneumonia was observed through administration of immune globulin, the efficacy of passive prophylaxis in premature infants has been studied. OBJECTIVES: This meta-analysis was performed to assess the effects of polyclonal respiratory syncytial virus hyperimmune globulin or monoclonal antibody in preventing RSV hospitalization, receipt of intensive care, mechanical ventilation, and mortality in those with underlying prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or congenital heart disease. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections trials register and MEDLINE in March, 1999. In addition, abstracts on these topics were sought from the Pediatric Academies Meetings and the Intersciences Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy for the years 1994 to 1997, inclusive. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized, controlled trials of prevention of RSV using immune globulin, respiratory syncytial virus immune globulin, or monoclonal RSV antibody in children with prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia or congenital heart disease. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently abstracted data and assessed study quality. Only incidences could be pooled because data for durations was summarized in a manner that did not allow combining results across the studies. MAIN RESULTS: Four studies with a total of 2598 subjects were included in the main analysis. All were randomized controlled trials. Two trials were not blinded. Three studies examined RSV hyperimmune globulin and one examined monoclonal RSV antibody. A study of a different monoclonal RSV antibody could not be included because it has not been presented or published. The pooled Peto Odds Ratios favoring prophylaxis were 0.48 (95% CI 0.37, 0.64), 0.47 (0.29, 0.77), and 0.99 (0.48, 2.07) for incidence of hospitalization, incidence of ICU admission, and incidence of mechanical ventilation, respectively. The numbers needed to prevent one hospitalization and one ICU admission are 17 and 50 respectively. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: RSVIG is effective in preventing RSV hospitalizations and admission to the intensive care unit, but not in preventing mechanical ventilation. There was a non-significant trend towards a higher mortality in children given RSVIG. (Wang E.E.; Tang N.K.) Replidyne, 472 Wheelers Farms Road, Milford, Connecticut, United States."
509,"Costs of hospitalization with respiratory syncytial virus illness among children aged <5 years and the financial impact on households in Bangladesh, 2010 BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of acute respiratory illness in young children and results in significant economic burden. There is no vaccine to prevent RSV illness but a number of vaccines are in development. We conducted this study to estimate the costs of severe RSV illness requiring hospitalization among children <5 years and associated financial impact on households in Bangladesh. Data of this study could be useful for RSV vaccine development and also the value of various preventive strategies, including use of an RSV vaccine in children if one becomes available.METHODS: From May through October 2010, children aged <5 years with laboratory-confirmed RSV were identified from a sentinel influenza program database at four tertiary hospitals. Research assistants visited case-patients' homes after hospital discharge and administered a structured questionnaire to record direct medical costs (physician consultation fee, costs for hospital bed, medicines and diagnostic tests); non-medical costs (costs for food, lodging and transportation); indirect costs (caregivers' productivity loss), and coping strategies used by families to pay for treatment. We used WHO-Choice estimates for routine health care service costs. We added direct, indirect and health care service costs to calculate cost-per-episode of severe RSV illness. We used Monte Carlo simulation to estimate annual economic burden for severe RSV illness.FINDINGS: We interviewed caregivers of 39 persons hospitalized for RSV illness. The median direct cost for hospitalization was US$ 62 (interquartile range [IQR] = 43-101), indirect cost was US$ 19 (IQR = 11-29) and total cost was US$ 94 (IQR = 67-127). The median out-of-pocket cost was 24% of monthly household income of affected families (US$ 143), and >50% families borrowed money to meet treatment cost. We estimated that the median direct cost of RSV-associated hospitalization in children aged <5 years in Bangladesh was US$ 10 million (IQR: US$ 7-16 million), the median indirect cost was US$ 3.0 million (IQR: 2-5 million) in 2010.CONCLUSION: RSV-associated hospitalization among children aged <5 years represents a substantial economic burden in Bangladesh. Affected families frequently incurred considerable out of pocket and indirect costs for treatment that resulted in financial hardship.

510,"Respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus infection in adult primary care patients: Association of age with prevalence, diagnostic features and illness course Objectives: To better target new vaccines and treatments being developed for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus (influenza), we studied the association of age with prevalence, diagnostic features and course of illness of these infections in primary care patients. Methods: Secondary analysis of observational data on the aetiology, diagnosis and prognosis in adults presenting to primary care with acute cough in 12 European countries (20072010) using regression analyses corrected for clustering of patients within countries. Age groups were 1859 years, 6074 years, and 75 years and older (75+). Results: Nasopharyngeal swabs for 144 (4.6%), 169 (5.4%) and 104 (3.4%) out of 3104 patients were polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive for RSV, influenza A and influenza B, respectively. RSV prevalence in patients 75+ (8.5%) was twice the prevalence in those under 60 years (4.2%). Influenza prevalence was not associated with age. Diagnostic features for these viruses were not associated with age. Symptom duration was associated with age for RSV and influenza B, but not for influenza A. The odds of unresolved symptoms after 28 days were associated with age for RSV only. Illness deterioration was associated with age for RSV, with patients 75+ at increased risk, but not for influenza. Conclusion: In adults presenting to primary care with acute cough, the diagnostic features of RSV or influenza infection are not associated with age. For RSV both the prevalence and illness course are significantly worse at higher age, for influenza only the illness course is. (Bruyndonckx R., robin.bruyndonckx@uhasselt.be; Hens N.)

511,"Breakthrough therapy designation of nirsevimab for the prevention of lower respiratory tract illness caused by respiratory syncytial virus infections (RSV) Introduction: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of serious lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in infants and young children. Palivizumab is an RSV-specific prophylactic for use in high-risk infants but treatment requires monthly injections and only modestly reduces hospitalization. Thus, new immunoprophylactic candidates are under development. Nirsevimab (MEDI8897) is a monoclonal antibody with an extended half-life developed to protect infants for an entire RSV season with a single dose. Areas Covered: This review summarizes clinical trial data on nirsevimab. The authors introduce RSV and surface viral proteins involved in infection, then discuss the development and achievements of nirsevimab in clinical trials concluding with expert opinion. Information was compiled from PubMed, clinicaltrials.gov, and press releases from AstraZeneca and Sanofi. Expert opinion: Nirsevimab (MEDI8897) is an RSV F protein monoclonal antibody and the next-generation RSV medicine having an extended half-life developed for the prevention of LRTI caused by RSV. Nirsevimab will supplant the current standard of care for RSV prevention. Importantly, nirsevimab requires a single dose to last the entire RSV season and may be given to term, preterm, and high-risk infants. However, even with nirsevimab approval there remains a need for an efficacious RSV vaccine and treatments.

512,"Characteristics and outcomes of patients hospitalized for infection with influenza, SARS-CoV-2 or respiratory syncytial virus in the season 2022/2023 in a large German primary care centre Background: In 2022/2023, Influenza A and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) reappeared in hospitalized patients, which was in parallel to ongoing SARS-CoV-2 infections. The aim of our study was to compare the characteristics and outcomes of these infections during the same time. Methods: We included patients of all ages with a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for Influenza A/B, RSV, or SARS-CoV-2 virus hospitalized in the neurological, internal or paediatric units of the RoMed Hospital Rosenheim, Germany, between October 1st 2022 and February 28th 2023. Results: A total of 906 patients were included (45.6% female; median age 68.0 years; 21.9% Influenza A, 48.2% SARS-CoV-2, 28.3% RSV). Influenza B (0.2%) and co-infections (1.5%) played a minor role. In patients aged  18 years (n = 637, 71%), Influenza A, SARS-CoV-2 and RSV groups differed in age (median 72, 79, 76 years, respectively; p < 0.001). Comorbidities, particularly asthma and COPD, were most prevalent for RSV. 103 patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) (16.3% Influenza A, 15.3% SARS-CoV-2, 19.2% RSV; p = 0.649), 56 died (6.8% Influenza A, 9% SARS-CoV-2, 11.1% RSV; p = 0.496). RSV showed the highest frequencies of low-flow oxygen supplementation for admission and stay. Differences in the length of stay were minor (median 7 days). Conversely, in patients aged < 18 years (n = 261, 28,8%), 19.5%, 17.6% and 60.2% were in the Influenza A, SARS-CoV-2 and RSV groups, respectively; 0.4% showed Influenza B and 2.3% co-infections. 17 patients were admitted to ICU (3.9% Influenza A, 9.6% RSV, 0% SARS-CoV-2); none died. RSV showed the highest frequencies of high- and low-flow oxygen supplementation, SARS-CoV-2 the lowest. Conclusion: When comparing infections with Influenza, SARS-CoV-2 and RSV in the winter 2022/2023 in hospitalized adult patients, rates of ICU admission and mortality were similar. RSV showed the highest frequencies of obstructive airway diseases, and of oxygen supplementation. The latter was also true in children/adolescents, in whom RSV dominated. Thus, in the situation of declining importance of SARS-CoV-2, RSV showed a disease burden that was relatively higher than that from Influenza and SARS-CoV-2 across ages, and this might be relevant for the seasons coming.

513,"Cardiac Troponin I as a Predictor of Respiratory Failure in Children Hospitalized with Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Infections: A Pilot Study This pilot study was performed to assess the use of cardiac troponin I to predict respiratory failure in children admitted to the hospital with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections. We enrolled a prospective convenience sample of children under 5 years of age who were admitted to our university-based, tertiary care children's hospital from December 1, 2000, to February 1, 2002, with RSV infections. A cardiac troponin I was drawn at admission. We assessed the test characteristics for positive cardiac troponin I (defined as >0.3 ng/mL, the manufacturer's upper limit of normal) in correctly identifying children who had respiratory failure as evidenced by the need for endotracheal intubation. Twenty-five children from 9 days to 38 months of age were included. Ten children had a positive cardiac troponin I and 3 of these children had respiratory failure. A positive cardiac troponin I demonstrated a sensitivity of 100%, specificity 68%, positive predictive value of 30%, negative predictive value of 100%, and accuracy of 72%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.939 (95% confidence interval, 0.820-1.0), suggesting a high degree of discriminatory power in selecting children with respiratory failure. A sample size calculation revealed that a follow-up study of 359 patients is needed before the clinical use of cardiac troponin I for this purpose.  2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

514,"An in vitro transepithelial migration assay to evaluate the role of neutrophils in Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) induced epithelial damage Large numbers of neutrophils migrate into the lungs of children with severe Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) disease. It is unclear how these cells contribute to viral clearance and recovery from infection or whether they contribute to disease pathology. We have developed a novel in vitro model to study neutrophil migration through airway epithelial cells (AECs), the main cellular target of RSV infection. Our model reproduces a physiologically relevant cell polarity and directionality of neutrophil migration. Using this model, we found that RSV infected AECs induced rapid neutrophil transepithelial migration. We also detected increased AEC damage associated with RSV infection, with a further increase in epithelial cells shedding from the Transwell membrane following neutrophil migration. This was not observed in the mock infected controls. Neutrophils that migrated through the RSV infected AECs showed increased cell surface expression of CD11B and MPO compared to neutrophils that had not migrated. In conclusion, our in vitro co-culture assay can be used to identify critical mechanisms that mediate epithelial cell damage and promote inflammation in children with severe RSV disease.

515,"Respiratory syncytial virus RSV infection has an estimated global incidence of 33 million cases in children <5 years of age, with 10% requiring hospital admission and up to 199 000 dying of the disease. There is growing evidence that severe infantile RSV bronchiolitis, a condition characterised by an inflammatory reaction to the virus, is associated with later childhood wheeze in some vulnerable children; however, a direct causal relationship with asthma has not yet been established. RSV infection is also increasingly recognised as a cause of morbidity and mortality in those with underlying airway disease, the immunocompromised and frail elderly persons. Novel molecular-based diagnostic tools are becoming established, but treatment remains largely supportive, with palivizumab the only licensed agent currently available for passive prophylaxis of selected pre-term infants. While effective treatments remain elusive, there is optimism about the testing of novel antiviral drugs and the development of vaccines that may induce long-lasting immunity without the risk of disease augmentation.

516,"The burden of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infection in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region across age groups: A systematic review Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is a common respiratory virus that generally causes a mild illness in children and adults or severe symptoms with complications in infants and the elderly, particularly in the presence of underlying comorbidities. While epidemiological data about this virus are available globally, data from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region are still scarce. For this reason, we conducted a systematic review to determine the burden of RSV disease in the MENA region by searching the available literature up until September 2018. A total of 1242 studies were retrieved of which 90 were included in the review. Most of the included studies were conducted in subjects aged 018 years with the majority being in children below 3 years of age, while only 2 studies included exclusively adults above 18 years of age. RSV infection rates varied greatly between different studies on hospitalized subjects and ranged between 4% and 82%, while the range was smaller in studies on outpatient subjects (between 6% and 36%). When calculating the RSV infection rates in the hospitalized subjects with different inclusion criteria, we found that it was 19%, 70%, and 33% among subjects admitted with Acute Respiratory Infections (ARIs), Acute Lower Respiratory Infections (ALRIs), and bronchiolitis, respectively. RSV infections were most common during the winter season. With regards to complications, intensive care unit admissions ranged between 1% and 15%, while the need for mechanical ventilation ranged between 1% and 10%. The overall RSV related mortality rate across all age groups in studies included in our review was 1.9%. This review identifies several limitations in the existing data and under-representation of the adult population. Future studies should be providing more evidence on the RSV burden in adults and children with comorbidities in order to better assess the potential impact of future preventive strategies in the MENA region.

517,"Impact of respiratory syncytial virus disease on quality of life in adults aged 50 years: A qualitative patient experience cross-sectional study Background: Information about the impact of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) on quality of life in older adults is limited. This study characterized the patient experience of RSV illness in USA older adults and assessed the content validity of the InFLUenza Patient Reported Outcome (FLU-PRO) in this population. Methods: This qualitative, non-interventional, cross-sectional study included hybrid concept elicitation and cognitive debriefing interviews with 30 individuals (age 50 years) with polymerase chain reaction-confirmed RSV diagnosed within 6 months of screening. Targeted literature review was first conducted to inform the development of interview materials. Webcam or telephone interviews were conducted by qualitative researchers using a semistructured interview guide. Interview transcripts were coded and analyzed using Excel and NVivo software. Results: All participants reported impacts on daily activities, social activities, and relationships during RSV disease. Physical functioning was impaired in 25 (83%) participants, and 18 (60%) reported not engaging in leisure activities/hobbies. All nine participants who were working reported major impacts on work. Most (n = 28; 93%) described emotional impacts. A majority (n = 19; 63%) reported symptoms lasting beyond the acute disease stage from a week to >1 month. Symptom concepts reported generally matched FLU-PRO items and domains. Cognitive debriefing indicated that FLU-PRO was easy to understand and captured participants' experiences of RSV illness. Conclusions: This study indicates that RSV disease in adults aged 50 years in the USA has substantial impacts on daily life and that the concepts included in FLU-PRO are appropriate and fit for purpose as a measure of RSV symptoms in this population.

518,"Respiratory syncytial virus neutralizing antibodies in cord blood, respiratory syncytial virus hospitalization, and recurrent wheeze Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) hospitalization is associated with wheeze. Objective: To examine the influence of maternally derived RSV neutralizing antibodies in cord blood on RSV hospitalization and recurrent wheeze in infancy. Methods: Among children from the Danish National Birth Cohort, we selected a subcohort of 459 randomly selected children, 408 children with RSV hospitalization, 408 children with recurrent wheeze, and all 289 children who experienced both RSV hospitalization and recurrent wheeze. The influence of cord blood RSV neutralizing antibodies was examined as predictors for (1) RSV hospitalization, (2) RSV hospitalization after recurrent wheeze, (3) recurrent wheeze, and (4) recurrent wheeze after RSV hospitalization. Results: Neutralizing antibody levels were inversely associated with RSV hospitalization in infants below 6 months of age (adjusted incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.74; 95% CI, 0.62-0.87), and also inversely associated with RSV hospitalization in infants with recurrent wheeze (IRR, 0.83; 0.71-0.97). In contrast, neutralizing antibody levels were directly associated with an increased risk of recurrent wheeze in infants below 6 months of age (IRR, 1.28; 1.04-1.57) and with an increased risk of recurrent wheeze after RSV hospitalization in infants below 6 months of age (IRR, 1.44; 1.10-1.90). Conclusion: Maternally derived RSV neutralizing antibodies protect infants against RSV hospitalization, and also when the infant has recurrent wheeze.

519,"Respiratory syncytial virus infection-associated hospitalization in adults: A retrospective cohort study Background: Once considered primarily a pediatric concern, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is gaining recognition as a cause of significant morbidity and mortality in adults. A better understanding of RSV epidemiology and disease in adults is needed to guide patient management and to assess the need for prophylaxis, vaccines, and treatments. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adults admitted to four hospitals in Toronto, Canada, between September 2012 and June 2013 with RSV identified by a qualitative real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay in nasopharyngeal swab or bronchoscopy specimens. Main outcomes were hospital length of stay, need for intensive care unit (ICU) or mechanical ventilation, and all-cause mortality. Results: Eighty-six patients were identified as requiring hospitalization for RSV infection (56% female). Median age was 74 (range 19-102) years; 29 (34%) were<65 years. Eighty-three (97%) had underlying chronic medical conditions; 27 (31%) were immunosuppressed, and 10 (12%) known smokers. The most common symptoms and signs were cough in 73 (85%), shortness of breath in 68 (79%), sputum production in 54 (63%), weakness in 43 (50%), fever in 41 (48%), and wheezing in 33 (38%). Lower respiratory tract complications occurred in 45 (52%), cardiovascular complications occurred in 19 (22%), and possible co-pathogens were identified in 11 (13%). Sixty-seven (78%) were treated with antibiotics and 31 (36%) with anti-influenza therapy. Thirteen (15%) required ICU care and 8 (9%) required mechanical ventilation. Five (6%) died during hospitalization. Need for ICU and mechanical ventilation were associated with mortality (P0.02). Median hospital length of stay was 6 days (mean 10.8 days). Conclusions: RSV infection is associated with the need for extended hospital stay, ICU care and mortality in adults of all ages with chronic underlying conditions. Presenting signs and symptoms are nonspecific, co-infections occur, and patients often receive antibiotics and anti-influenza therapy. There is need for ongoing research and development of RSV prophylaxis, vaccines and treatments for adults.

The present study was designed to test our hypothesis that the use of antibiotics would not lead to a reduced duration of hospitalization n mild to moderate RSV LRTD. Methods: Seventy-one patients <24 months of age with a virologically confirmed clinical diagnosis of RSV LRTD were randomized to azithromycin 10 mg/kg/day (n-32) or placebo (n-39) in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled equivalence trial during three RSV seasons (2002-2004 through 2005-2006). Primary endpoint was duration of hospitalization, secondary endpoints included duration of oxygen supplementation and nasogastric tube feeding, course of RSV symptom score, number of PICU referrals and number of patients who received additional antibiotic treatment. Data were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle using the Mann-Whitney U-test or (Z)(2) test considering P < 0.05 as statistically significant. Results: Included patients were comparable with respect to baseline demographics, clinical characteristics, laboratory and roentgenologic investigations. The mean duration of hospitalization was not significantly different between patients treated with azithromycin or placebo (132.0  10.8 vs. 139.6  7.7 hr, P = 0.328). Azithromycin was not associated with a stronger resolution of clinical symptoms represented by the RSV symptom score.

521,"Preventing severe respiratory syncytial virus disease: Passive, activeimmunisation and new antivirals In most high-income countries palivizumab prophylaxis is considered safe, efficacious and cost-effective for preventing respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) hospital admissions among specific subgroups of infants born preterm, with chronic lung disease or with congenital heart disease. Virtually all babies acquire RSV during infancy and previously healthy babies are not eligible to receive palivizumab. Emerging evidence suggests some benefit of palivizumab use in reducing recurrent wheeze among infants born preterm. Better longitudinal studies are needed to examine its clinical and cost-effectiveness on recurrent and chronic respiratory illness and associated healthcare burden on resources in the community and hospitals. Since 99% of child deaths attributed to RSV occur in resource poor countries where expensive prophylaxis is not available or affordable, palivizumab has limited potential to impact on the current global burden of RSV lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). A range of candidate vaccines for active immunisation against RSV are now in clinical trials. Two promising new antivirals are also currently in phase I/II trials to test their effectiveness in preventing severe RSV LRTI. These agents may be effective in preventing severe disease and phase III studies are in development. In the absence of effective active immunisation against RSV infection, population level approaches to prevent severe RSV LRTI should continue to focus on reducing prenatal and environmental risk factors including prematurity, smoking and improving hygiene practices.

522,"Respiratory syncytial virus infection Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common worldwide cause of lower respiratory tract infections (LRI) in infants less than 12 months of age. RSV isolates can be divided into group A and B. In addition, there were many genotypes within each group, and these genotypes have evolved global setting with temporal and geographic clustering. Many cellular genes encoding cytokines and chemokines which are activated by RSV infection has now been focused for the elucidation of pathophysiology of RSV LRI. The prophylaxis against RSV infection by vaccination has been unsuccessful because of its adverse effects. No valuable anti-RSV drugs for clinical use have been yet developed. Therefore RSV LRI has been treated mainly symptomatically. Recently humanized anti-RSV F protein monoclonal antibody was developed and prescribed for prevention in high-risk infants such as premature ones and those with chronic lung and congenital heart diseases. It reduced the incidence of hospitalization significantly. (Tsutsumi H.) Department of Pediatrics, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine."
523,"Prospective Attitudes towards Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Vaccination: Validation of a Survey Instrument among Young Females in Jordan Pending Vaccine Authorization In May 2023, the U.S. FDA advisors endorsed Pfizers pregnancy-administered vaccine (branded ABRYSVO) to protect infants from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. Vaccination can reduce the burden of RSV-related respiratory disease, with previous studies showing its substantial medical and financial burden in Jordan. However, pregnant women may exhibit hesitancy to get vaccinated due to concerns about potential risks to themselves or their fetuses. This study aimed to assess the acceptance of the RSV vaccine among young females and identify the determinants influencing their decision using a newly constructed instrument. A survey instrument was developed and validated, comprising 26 items to measure RSV vaccine acceptance. A cross-sectional study design was employed, with data collection from a sample of females aged 18 to 45 residing in Jordan during 56 July 2023, using a convenient approach via an online distributed questionnaire. The final study sample comprised 315 respondents, with 67.6% who have heard of RSV before the study. If the vaccine was safe, effective, and provided freely, 70.2% showed willingness to get the RSV vaccine, 15.2% resisted, and 14.6% were hesitant. Principal component analysis identified six internally consistent sub-scales with the following suggested themes: Advice, Burden, Conspiracy, Dangers, Efficiency, and Fear, comprising 21 items collectively as assigned as the ABCDEF scale for RSV vaccine acceptance. RSV vaccine acceptance in this study was associated with the advice and fear constructs. The validated survey instrument successfully captured important determinants of RSV vaccine acceptance among young females. RSV vaccine promotion efforts should focus on the following: enhancing vaccine education, improving trust in healthcare institutions and providers, reducing burdens through resolving cost issues and focusing on the role of social support, addressing safety concerns, and tailoring communication strategies to effectively promote the benefits of the vaccine. These insights can inform public health policies and interventions aiming to promote RSV vaccination and mitigate the burden of RSV-related diseases among infants.

524,"Phenotype of acute respiratory syncytial virus induced lower respiratory tract illness in infancy and subsequent morbidity The objective of this study was to investigate the association hypothesis that outcome following respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) induced bronchiolitis (RSVB) and RSV induced wheeze (RSVW) are different. At 3 years respiratory symptoms were more common in those with RSV infection than the control group but there was no increase in allergic sensitisation (11% vs 10%). Those with RSVW were more likely to have evidence of allergic sensitisation when compared with RSVB subjects (22% vs 7%), and have increased symptoms and increased use of inhaled steroids. Conclusion: The data argue that RSV infection during infancy does not induce allergic asthma and that host factors rather than the virus determine long-term outcomes.  2007 The Author(s).

526,"Expected effect of palivizumab on the reduction of infant mortality and hospitalizations rates due to respiratory syncytial virus infection Objective. To assess the impact of preventive therapy with palivizumab against respiratory syncytial viral (RSV) infection on the indicator of the implementation of the Unified plan to achieve national goals of the Russian Federation and on the infant mortality rate. Patients and methods. Preterm infants born prior to 35 weeks gestation were considered as target population for immunization with palivizumab. We modeled an increase in palivizumab coverage to 25% by 2024 and calculated the expected number of deaths and hospitalizations that can be prevented using palivizumab. We also calculated targeted values of infant mortality reduction (for the entire country and individual regions) that can be achieved by increasing palivizumab coverage. Results. Annual increase of RSV prophylaxis coverage will prevent 49, 63 and 76 deaths in Russia in 2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively. This will ensure a 36.3%, 48.4%, and 60.5% reduction in infant mortality in 2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively, which will facilitate the achievement of targeted indicators specified in the National development goals of the Russian Federation. Moreover, it will prevent 904, 1142, and 1381 hospitalizations due to RSV in 2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively. Conclusion. Wider use of palivizumab will decrease the hospitalization rate and will facilitate the achievement of the targeted indicator reduction of infant mortality within the Federal Project Improvement of children's healthcare..

527,"Net cost of palivizumab for respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis during the 1998/99 season in northern Alberta OBJECTIVE: Palivizumab has been shown to decrease respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) hospitalization rates in preterm infants and infants with chronic lung disease. The objective of the present study was to determine whether the use of palivizumab during the 1998/99 RSV season would have resulted in a cost-saving in infants discharged from Edmonton hospitals. DESIGN: A retrospective study of RSV hospitalizations was performed by contacting parents and reviewing hospital lists. The net cost of using palivizumab was determined by comparing the cost of giving the drug from November 1, 1998 to April 1, 1999 with the cost of potentially averted medical transports and hospitalizations. POPULATION: One hundred fifty-nine infants discharged from Edmonton hospitals who met the Canadian Paediatric Society's criteria for receiving palivizumab during the 1998/99 RSV season were studied. RESULTS: The cost of using palivizumab in these 159 study infants would have been $753,300. The infants had 21 RSV hospitalizations and required four medical transports. The estimated cost of RSV hospital-based care for these infants was $168,888. Assuming a drug efficacy of 39% in infants with chronic lung disease and 78% in infants born before 33 weeks' gestation with no chronic lung disease, $121,147 of these costs could have been averted if palivizumab had been used. CONCLUSIONS: The net cost to the health care system of using palivizumab, as recommended in the Canadian Paediatric Society guidelines, in study infants in northern Alberta during the 1998/99 RSV season would have been $632,153.

528,"Respiratory syncytial immunoprophylaxis with palivizumab Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a serious pathogen causing significant morbidity, especially in premature infants and infants with chronic lung disease or significant congenital heart disease. There is no specific treatment for RSV infection and the therapy is essentially supportive. Therefore, prophylaxis is the best strategy against RSV disease. Passive immunization with monoclonal antibodies (palivizumab) provides protection against severe RSV infection and significantly reduces hospitalizations in high-risk childrens. However, palizumab is an expensive drug and its use should be reserved for children at the highest risk of severe RSV disease. (De Halleux V., vdehalleux@chu.ulg.ac.be; Lombet J.)

531,"Seasonality of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Hospitalization Seasonality of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is an area of limited knowledge. In this study, we set out to get insight into the epidemic characteristics of RSV. We retrospectively evaluated medical files of 512 hospitalizations in children due to RSV infection from January 2010 to July 2017. In this cohort of patients, there were 96.3% of children below 1 year of age; the median age was 2.8 months. The influence of weather condition during the week of hospitalization (WH) and also the preceding week (WP) on the rate of hospitalizations was also assessed. An overview of morbidity data demonstrates that the epidemic RSV season started from Week 50 of a year and lasts until Week 15 of the following year, with a peak between Week 4 and Week 10. The average monthly percentage rate of morbidity per year was as follows: December, 12.3%; January, 24.5%; February, 29%; and March, 21.7%. Hospitalizations were positively associated with the minimum and maximum outside air temperature during the WH (62.5% and 59.7%, respectively) and the WP (64.3% and 63.4%, respectively) and with relative humidity (WH 23% and WP 29.8%). A weak association with the wind speed was also noticed (WH 22% and WP 21%), while there was no influence of the level of atmospheric pressure on RSV morbidity. We conclude that seasonality of RSV is present between December and April each year, and morbidity is mostly influenced by minimum-maximum outside air temperature changes. Further epidemiological exploration is required to get a better knowledge on both active and passive immunization against RSV.

532,"Respiratory syncytial virus infection in cattle Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a cause of respiratory disease in cattle worldwide. It has an integral role in enzootic pneumonia in young dairy calves and summer pneumonia in nursing beef calves. Furthermore, bovine RSV infection can predispose calves to secondary bacterial infection by organisms such as Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, and Histophilus somni, resulting in bovine respiratory disease complex, the most prevalent cause of morbidity and mortality among feedlot cattle. Even in cases where animals do not succumb to bovine respiratory disease complex, there can be long-term losses in production performance. This includes reductions in feed efficiency and rate of gain in the feedlot, as well as reproductive performance, milk production, and longevity in the breeding herd. As a result, economic costs to the cattle industry from bovine respiratory disease have been estimated to approach $1 billion annually due to death losses, reduced performance, and costs of vaccinations and treatment modalities. Human and bovine RSV are closely related viruses with similarities in histopathologic lesions and mechanisms of immune modulation induced following infection. Therefore, where appropriate, we provide comparisons between RSV infections in humans and cattle. This review article discusses key aspects of RSV infection of cattle, including epidemiology and strain variability, clinical signs and diagnosis, experimental infection, gross and microscopic lesions, innate and adaptive immune responses, and vaccination strategies.

533,"Economic-burden trajectories in commercially insured US infants with respiratory syncytial virus infection Background This study evaluates the long-term respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) burden among preterm and full-term infants in the United States. Methods Infants with birth hospitalization claims and 24 months of continuous enrollment were retrospectively identified in the Truven MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters database for the period 1 January 2004-30 September 2015. Infants with RSV infection in the first year of life (n = 38 473) were matched to controls (n = 76 825), and remaining imbalances in the number of individuals in each group were adjusted using propensity score methods. All-cause, respiratory-related, and asthma/ wheezing-related 5-year average cumulative costs were measured. Results Early premature (n = 213), premature (n = 397), late premature (n = 4446), and full-term (n = 33 417) RSV-infected infants were matched to 424, 791, 8875, and 66 735 controls, respectively. After 2 years since RSV diagnosis, all-cause cumulative costs for RSV-infected infants as compared to those for controls increased by $22 081 (95% confidence interval [CI], $5800-$42 543) for early premature infants, by $14 034 (95% CI, $5095- $22 973) for premature infants, by $10 164 (95% CI, $8835-$11 493) for late premature infants, and by $5404 (95% CI, $5110-$5698) for full-term infants. The 5-year RSV burden increased to $39 490 (95% CI, $18 217-$60 764), $23 160 (95% CI, $13 002-$33 317),$13 755 (95% CI, $12 097-$15 414), and $6631 (95% CI, $6060-$7202), respectively. The RSV burden was higher when stratified by inpatient and outpatient setting and respiratory-related and asthma/wheezing-related costs. Conclusions The RSV burden extends across cost domains and prematurity, with the greatest burden incurred by the second year of follow-up.

535,"Predictors of all-cause mortality among patients hospitalized with influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, or SARS-CoV-2 Background: Shared and divergent predictors of clinical severity across respiratory viruses may support clinical and community responses in the context of a novel respiratory pathogen. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study to identify predictors of 30-day all-cause mortality following hospitalization with influenza (N = 45,749; 2010-09 to 2019-05), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV; N = 24 345; 2010-09 to 2019-04), or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; N = 8988; 2020-03 to 2020-12; pre-vaccine) using population-based health administrative data from Ontario, Canada. Multivariable modified Poisson regression was used to assess associations between potential predictors and mortality. We compared the direction, magnitude, and confidence intervals of risk ratios to identify shared and divergent predictors of mortality. Results: A total of 3186 (7.0%), 697 (2.9%), and 1880 (20.9%) patients died within 30 days of hospital admission with influenza, RSV, and SARS-CoV-2, respectively. Shared predictors of increased mortality included older age, male sex, residence in a long-term care home, and chronic kidney disease. Positive associations between age and mortality were largest for patients with SARS-CoV-2. Few comorbidities were associated with mortality among patients with SARS-CoV-2 as compared with those with influenza or RSV. Conclusions: Our findings may help identify patients at greatest risk of illness secondary to a respiratory virus, anticipate hospital resource needs, and prioritize local prevention and therapeutic strategies to communities with higher prevalence of risk factors.

Study design Retrospective data from 684 infants with bronchiolitis or RSV pneumonia, 1 year old, admitted to 10 children's hospitals from April 1995 to September 1996. Outcomes included complication rates and effects on hospital and pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) length of stay (LOS) and hospital costs. Results: Most infants (79%) had one or more complication, with serious complications in 24%. Even minor complications were associated with significantly longer PICU and hospital LOS and higher costs (P < .001). Respiratory complications were most frequent (60%), but infectious (41%), cardiovascular (9%), electrolyte imbalance (19%), and other complications (9%) were common. Complication rates were higher in former premature infants (87%), infants with congenital heart disease (93%), and infants with other congenital abnormalities (90%) relative to infants without risk factors (76%). Infants 33 to 35 weeks gestational age (GA) had the highest complication rates (93%), longer hospital LOS, and higher costs (P < .004) than other former premature infants. Conclusions: Complications were common in infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis or RSV pneumonia and were associated with longer LOS and higher costs. Former premature infants and infants with congenital abnormalities are at significantly greater risk for complications.

538,"Deaths Attributed to Respiratory Syncytial Virus in Young Children in High-Mortality Rate Settings: Report from Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS) Background: Lower respiratory tract infections are a leading cause of death in young children, but few studies have collected the specimens needed to define the role of specific causes. The Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS) platform aims to investigate causes of death in children aged <5 years in high-mortality rate settings, using postmortem minimally invasive tissue sampling and other advanced diagnostic techniques. We examined findings for deaths identified in CHAMPS sites in 7 countries in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia to evaluate the role of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Methods: We included deaths that occurred between December 2016 and December 2019. Panels determined causes of deaths by reviewing all available data including pathological results from minimally invasive tissue sampling, polymerase chain reaction screening for multiple infectious pathogens in lung tissue, nasopharyngeal swab, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid samples, clinical information from medical records, and verbal autopsies. Results: We evaluated 1213 deaths, including 695 in neonates (aged <28 days), 283 in infants (28 days to <12 months), and 235 in children (12-59 months). RSV was detected in postmortem specimens in 67 of 1213 deaths (5.5%); in 24 deaths (2.0% of total), RSV was determined to be a cause of death, and it contributed to 5 other deaths. Younger infants (28 days to <6 months of age) accounted for half of all deaths attributed to RSV; 6.5% of all deaths in younger infants were attributed to RSV. RSV was the underlying and only cause in 4 deaths; the remainder (n = 20) had a median of 2 (range, 1-5) other conditions in the causal chain. Birth defects (n = 8) and infections with other pathogens (n = 17) were common comorbid conditions. Conclusions: RSV is an important cause of child deaths, particularly in young infants. These findings add to the substantial body of literature calling for better treatment and prevention options for RSV in high-mortality rate settings. (Blau D.M.)

539,"Evaluation of the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of ALN-RSV01, a novel RNAi antiviral therapeutic directed against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) work through RNA interference (RNAi), the natural RNA inhibitory pathway, to down-regulate protein production by inhibiting targeted mRNA in a sequence-specific manner. ALN-RSV01 is an siRNA directed against the mRNA encoding the N-protein of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) that exhibits specific in vitro and in vivo anti-RSV activity. The results of two safety and tolerability studies with ALN-RSV01 involving 101 healthy adults (65 active, 36 placebo, single- and multiple dose, observer-blind, randomized dose-escalation) are described. Intranasal administration of ALN-RSV01 was well tolerated over a dose range up through 150 mg as a single dose and for five daily doses. Adverse events were similar in frequency and severity to placebo (normal saline) and were transient, mild to moderate, with no dose-dependent trend. The frequency or severity of adverse events did not increase with increasing ALN-RSV01 exposure. All subjects completed all treatments and assessments with no early withdrawals or serious adverse events. Physical examinations, vital signs, ECGs and laboratory tests were normal. Systemic bioavailability of ALN-RSV01 was minimal. ALN-RSV01 appears safe and well tolerated when delivered intranasally and is a promising therapeutic candidate for further clinical development.  2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A descriptive analysis of the hospitalisations was performed, including hospitalisation rates (HR) and case-fatality rates (CFR%) calculation. For those with NTS as Main Diagnosis logistic regression were used to estimate the relationship between the different factors and death outcome. 21,660 registered NTS-related hospitalisations were described (88.8% with Salmonella coded as Main Diagnosis). Average HR(20102015) was 7.7 (range, 7.3 to 8.1) hospitalisations/100,000 population. Those with NTS infections as Secondary Diagnosis were on average (p < 0.001) older (47.9 vs. 36.5 years), presented worse Charlson Comorbidity Index (2.1 vs. 1.2), higher CFR% (4.8% vs. 0.7%), spent more days hospitalised (15.1 vs. 5.8 days), and generated more costs (6173 vs. 4272 euros/per hospitalisation) than those with NTS as Main Diagnosis. For those with NTS as Main Diagnosis increased risk of death was related to being > 64 years old (OR = 20.99; p < 0.001); presenting septicaemia (OR = 15.82; p < 0.001) or localised infections (OR = 3.98; p = 0.061); Charlson Comorbidity Index > 3 (OR = 4.57; p < 0.001); a non-HIV co-infection (OR = 1.80; p = 0.013); other risk factors (OR = 5.70; p < 0.001); bowel perforation (OR = 70.30; p < 0.001); or acute renal failure (OR = 1.95; p = 0.001). In those with Salmonella as Main Diagnosis, among all complications, bowel perforation presented the strongest association with death outcome. Clinical practice guidelines can help to identify patients at risk of bowel perforation to reduce the fatality of the disease.

541,"Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection: Its Propensity for Bacterial Coinfection and Related Mortality in Elderly Adults Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an increasingly recognized cause of acute respiratory infection (ARI) in adults. We compared the crude in-hospital mortality of patients with RSV infection alone with that of patients with RSV-bacterial coinfection. Overall, 12 144 hospitalized patients with ARI were screened for RSV detection by polymerase chain reaction between February 2014 and April 2019. In total, 701 (5.8%) had a positive RSV result, including 85 (12.1%) with bacterial coinfection. RSV-bacterial coinfection was associated with an increase in crude in-hospital mortality in patients >65 years old (hazard ratio, 2.94; 95% CI, 1.30-6.60; P =.010). Optimized prevention and management strategies to reduce this burden are needed.

542,"Respiratory syncytial virus infections in infants and children with congenital heart disease: Update on the evidence of prevention with palivizumab PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Lower respiratory tract infections multiply morbidity and mortality within patients with significant congenital heart disease (CHD). For respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), one of the most important pathogens, immunoprophylaxis with palivizumab has successfully been introduced. The question is which patients will benefit most from this costly preventive treatment. RECENT FINDINGS: The era after the introduction of palivizumab has revealed a steep decrease in mortality. The markers of success - hospital stays, admission to the intensive care unit, days on mechanical ventilation, and death - consistently favor immunoprophylaxis. The key point of treatment success remains in all cases a careful patient selection, adherence to a time limit of 30 days between the injections and early use after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, as well as avoidance of nosocomial-acquired infections. Preventive therapy with palivizumab in patients with CHD has been investigated in terms of operating efficiency - with the lowest costs per quality-adjusted life years compared with preterm infants with or without bronchopulmonary dysplasia. SUMMARY: The burden of RSV disease will decline, once a vaccine is available. Meanwhile, immunoprophylaxis with palivizumab is a useful tool for high-risk patients to reduce comorbidity and fatal outcome. Pharmacoeconomic considerations measuring quality-adjusted life years indicate important information about cost-effectiveness. Copyright  2013 2013 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

545,"Should respiratory care in preterm infants include prophylaxis against respiratory syncytial virus? The case against Preterm infants are at increased risk of severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. The monoclonal antibody palivizumab reduces the frequency of preterm infants being admitted to hospital with RSV infection. However, palivizumab is expensive, has to be given by intramuscular injection monthly for 5 months and has to be given prophylactically to 17 preterm children to prevent one hospital admission with RSV and to 59 children to prevent one intensive care admission. Cost-effectiveness analyses have not shown that palivizumab is cost-effective for any sub-group with sufficient certainty to recommend its public funding. Palivizumab will only be cost-effective if the price drops. Paying for palivizumab is an opportunity cost; the money could be spent better on other more cost-effective health care interventions. Palivizumab should not be prescribed for any preterm child unless it can be shown to be cost-effective in that situation.  2013.

546,"Preventing severe respiratory syncytial virus disease: Passive, active immunisation and new antivirals In most high-income countries palivizumab prophylaxis is considered safe, efficacious and cost-effective for preventing respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) hospital admissions among specific subgroups of infants born preterm, with chronic lung disease or with congenital heart disease. Virtually all babies acquire RSV during infancy and previously healthy babies are not eligible to receive palivizumab. Emerging evidence suggests some benefit of palivizumab use in reducing recurrent wheeze among infants born preterm. Better longitudinal studies are needed to examine its clinical and cost-effectiveness on recurrent and chronic respiratory illness and associated healthcare burden on resources in the community and hospitals. Since 99% of child deaths attributed to RSV occur in resource poor countries where expensive prophylaxis is not available or affordable, palivizumab has limited potential to impact on the current global burden of RSV lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). A range of candidate vaccines for active immunisation against RSV are now in clinical trials. Two promising new antivirals are also currently in phase I/II trials to test their effectiveness in preventing severe RSV LRTI. These agents may be effective in preventing severe disease and phase III studies are in development. In the absence of effective active immunisation against RSV infection, population level approaches to prevent severe RSV LRTI should continue to focus on reducing prenatal and environmental risk factors including prematurity, smoking and improving hygiene practices.

548,"Communicable diseases prioritized for surveillance and epidemiological research: Results of a standardized prioritization procedure in Germany, 2011 Introduction: To establish strategic priorities for the German national public health institute (RKI) and guide the institute's mid-term strategic decisions, we prioritized infectious pathogens in accordance with their importance for national surveillance and epidemiological research. Methods: We used the Delphi process with internal (RKI) and external experts and a metric-consensus approach to score pathogens according to ten three-tiered criteria. Additional experts were invited to weight each criterion, leading to the calculation of a median weight by which each score was multiplied. We ranked the pathogens according to the total weighted score and divided them into four priority groups. Results: 127 pathogens were scored. Eighty-six experts participated in the weighting; ""Case fatality rate"" was rated as the most important criterion. Twenty-six pathogens were ranked in the highest priority group; among those were pathogens with internationally recognised importance (e.g., Human Immunodeficiency Virus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Influenza virus, Hepatitis C virus, Neisseria meningitides), pathogens frequently causing large outbreaks (e.g., Campylobacter spp.), and nosocomial pathogens associated with antimicrobial resistance. Other pathogens in the highest priority group included Helicobacter pylori, Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Varicella zoster virus and Hantavirus. Discussion: While several pathogens from the highest priority group already have a high profile in national and international health policy documents, high scores for other pathogens (e.g., Helicobacter pylori, Respiratory syncytial virus or Hantavirus) indicate a possible under-recognised importance within the current German public health framework. A process to strengthen respective surveillance systems and research has been started. The prioritization methodology has worked well; its modular structure makes it potentially useful for other settings.  2011 Balabanova et al.

Thus, 1979-1997 multiple cause-of-death records for children <5 years old listing bronchiolitis, pneumonia, or any respiratory tract disease were examined. Deaths among children associated with any respiratory disease declined from 4631 in 1979 to 2502 in 1997. During the 19-year study period, 1806 bronchiolitis-associated deaths occurred (annual mean, 95 deaths; range, 66-127 deaths). Of these deaths, 1435 (79%) occurred among infants <1 year old. Congenital heart disease, lung disease, or prematurity was listed in death records of 179 (9.9%), 99 (5.5%), and 76 (4.2%) children dying with bronchiolitis, respectively. By applying published proportions of children hospitalized for bronchiolitis or pneumonia who were RSV-infected to bronchiolitis and pneumonia deaths, it was estimated that 510 RSV-associated deaths occurred annually during the study period, fewer than previously estimated.

550,"Surveillance for outbreaks of respiratory tract infections in nursing homes Background: Outbreaks of respiratory tract infections are common in long-term care facilities for older people. The objective of our study was to determine both the frequency of such outbreaks and their clinical and epidemiological features. Methods: Prospective surveillance for outbreaks of respiratory tract infections and a retrospective audit of surveillance records were conducted in 5 nursing homes in metropolitan Toronto over 3 years. The clinical manifestations of infected residents were identified and microbiological investigations for causal agents were conducted. Results: Sixteen outbreaks, involving 480 of 1313 residents, were identified prospectively during 1 144 208 resident-days of surveillance, for an overall rate of 0.42 infections per 1000 resident-days. Another 30 outbreaks, involving 388 residents, were identified retrospectively. Outbreaks occurred year-round, with no seasonal pattern. Pathogens included influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, Legionella sainthelensi and Chlamydia pneumoniae. Multiple pathogens were detected in 38% (6/16) of the prospectively identified outbreaks. Of the 480 residents in the prospectively identified outbreaks 398 (83%) had a cough, 194 (40%) had fever and 215 (45%) had coryza. Clinical findings were nonspecific and could not be used to distinguish between causal agents. Pneumonia developed in 72 (15%) of the 480 residents, and 58 (12%) required transfer to hospital. The case-fatality rate was 8% (37/480). Interpretation: Our findings emphasize the importance of adequate surveillance for outbreaks of respiratory tract infections in nursing homes and of early diagnosis so that appropriate interventions can be promptly instituted.

552,"Respiratory syncytial virus epidemiology in Turkey Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infections in infants and young children worldwide. This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of RSV among high-risk children admitted with respiratory symptoms in a developing country. This is a multicenter study conducted among children less than 24 months of age and admitted to the hospital with respiratory symptoms. The inclusion criteria included: lower respiratory tract symptoms on admission, gestational age less than 35 weeks, and admission age less than six months, or children less than 24 months of age with a diagnosis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia requiring medical treatment or intervention during the last six months or with an uncorrected congenital heart disease (other than patent ductus arteriosus). Nasopharyngeal samples were obtained with one of the three standard methods: nasopharyngeal aspirate, nasopharyngeal wash or nasopharyngeal swab. RSV antigen was determined by enzyme immunoassay using Abbott TESTPACK RSV (No. 8100/2027-16). Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t-test and chi-square test. In this study, 332 children (135 females, 40.7%; 197 males, 59.3%) were included, and the nasopharyngeal specimens of 98 (29.5%) children were determined to be RSV-positive. There were no differences in sex, age of gestation, age of admission, family education, number of siblings and smoking at home for RSV-positive and -negative cases. Furthermore, underlying disease and duration of hospital and intensive care unit stay were similar among groups. Only otitis media was more common among RSV-positive cases. No fatality at hospital was recorded. Frozen samples revealed more negative results. Most cases presented during winter and the number of RSV-positive cases was higher in cold and economically poor areas. Premature children and children with underlying medical con dition acquire RSV irrespective of other sociodemographic risk factors, and most of them are hospitalized. Thus, an RSV vaccine seems the most effective mode of protection to decrease morbidity and mortality. (Kanra G.; Kara A.; Ozmert E.; Yurdakok M.)

553,"Factors predicting length of stay in bronchiolitis Introduction: Despite advances in medical knowledge, the treatment of viral bronchiolitis is mainly supportive. Antiviral therapies are being investigated in clinical trials. Identifying population-attributable risk factors for RSV hospitalization may help prioritizing targeted treatment. Aim: To utilize MDClone, a data acquisition tool, to examine factors associated with the risk of hospitalization and length of stay (LOS) in bronchiolitis. Methods: A single tertiary medical center retrospective study. Infants discharged with a diagnosis of bronchiolitis between January 2001 and March 2019 were included. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, microbiologic parameters and co-morbidities were collected. Correlations with the risk of hospitalization and LOS were examined. Results: A total of 4793 infants with bronchiolitis, 3851 (80.3%) previously healthy, were seen; 975 visited emergency room only; 3311 were hospitalized in pediatric wards and 507 required pediatric intensive care unit. O(2) saturation, age and fever correlated with the risk of hospitalization (OR = 0.703, p < 0.0001, OR = 0.4, p = 0.024 and OR = 2.388, p < 0.0001, respectively). Saturation, fever, gestational age and birth weight correlated with LOS (r = 0.283, p = 0.000; r = 0.16, p = 0.000; r = 0.12, p = 0.00; and r = 0.117, p = 0.00, respectively). Rates of hospitalization were higher (81.1% vs. 75.6%, p = 0.0008) and LOS was longer (median 2.97 vs. 2.73 days, p < 0.001) in Arabs than in Jews. In a multivariate model, saturation, fever, gestational age and age predicted LOS. Saturation and ethnicity predicted LOS for previously healthy infants. Prematurity and cardiac anomalies increased LOS (p = 0.016 and p < 0.0001, respectively). Conclusions: Population-based data may enable predicting disease severity and LOS in bronchiolitis. Focusing on children at greatest risk may aid targeting new therapies.

556,"Respiratory syncytial virus testing during bronchiolitis episodes of care in an integrated health care delivery system: A retrospective cohort study Background: Bronchiolitis has the highest incidence rate of any lower respiratory infection among infants and children <2 years of age. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common etiology of bronchiolitis. The American Academy of Pediatrics does not recommend routine RSV testing for infants and children with bronchiolitis. The clinical predictors of RSV testing are unknown.Objectives: The aims of this study were to identify the rates and predictors of RSV testing during bronchiolitis and to explore the relationship between RSV test results and antibiotic treatment among infants and children aged <2 years.Methods: A retrospective study was conducted of 123,264 infants 32 weeks' gestational age (GA) who were born at 1 of 6 Northern California Kaiser Permanente Medical Center Program hospitals between 1996 and 2004. A bronchiolitis episode of care (EOC) was defined as 1 medical encounters with a bronchiolitis diagnosis code followed by 14 clear days without a bronchiolitis-related medical encounter. Descriptive statistics were used to report the frequency of tests, and logistic regression was used to assess the effect of hospitalization, chronologic age, gestational age, and season on the frequency of testing for RSV. Rapid direct fluorescent antibody testing was performed during the study.Results: The birth cohort was 51.2% male and 42.7% white, 20.8% Hispanic, 20.3% Asian, 8.4% African American, and 7.9% other. Of 23,748 bronchiolitis EOCs, 4969 (20.9%) had 1 test for RSV. Overall, 44.2% of all tests were positive for RSV. Physicians ordered RSV tests in 30.4% and 26.7% of bronchiolitis EOCs for infants born at 32 to 33 and 34 to 36 weeks' GA, respectively, compared with 17.9% of bronchiolitis EOCs for infants born at 41 weeks' GA. Bronchiolitis hospitalization, younger chronologic age, prematurity, and RSV season were associated with RSV testing in a multivariate model controlling for other variables, with an adjusted odds ratio (AOR) of 28.55 (95% CI, 24.99-36.62) for hospitalization status; AOR of 6.89 (95% CI, 5.19-9.15) for chronologic age <1 month; AOR of 0.85 (95% CI, 0.76-0.95) for GA >41 weeks; and AOR of 2.48 (95% CI, 2.24-2.74) for RSV season (December-March). Among hospitalized infants who were tested and had a diagnostic code suggesting treatment with antibiotics, use of antibiotics was significantly lower among those with a positive RSV test (63.4%) than those with a negative RSV test (75.5%) ((2) test; P < 0.001).Conclusions: Approximately 20% of these children with bronchiolitis EOCs were tested for RSV; of those tested, about half were positive. In this integrated health care system, hospitalization with bronchiolitis, chronologic age, gestational age <37 weeks, neonatal oxygen exposure, and bronchiolitis EOC during the RSV season were the factors associated with testing for RSV.  2010 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc.

557,"Preventing pediatric respiratory syncytial virus infection Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in infants is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Despite intense research efforts, safe and effective vaccines have remained elusive. Risk factors for the development of severe disease are well known, and those infants at highest risk are identified to receive RSV prophylaxis in the form of anti-RSV monoclonal antibody. Still, many other infant groups remain at risk and could benefit from an effective RSV prevention program. An explosion of clinic research activity is bringing unprecedented progress. Several of the most promising approaches currently being evaluated in clinical trials are reviewed. (Domachowske J., domachoj@upstate.edu; Halczyn J.; Bonville C.A.)

558,"Respiratory morbidity 20 years after RSV infection in infancy Epidemiological data suggest that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in early life is a risk factor for later asthma. There are no prospective studies on RSV infection starting from infancy progressing through childhood into adulthood. We followed up a cohort of children, hospitalized for RSV bronchiolitis or RSV pneumonia before age 24 months, until age 18-20 years. The aim of the study was to evaluate early RSV infection as a risk factor for asthma, bronchial reactivity, and lung function abnormalities in young adults. The participants filled in a questionnaire on asthma and asthma-like symptoms. The clinical study included flow-volume spirometry (FVS), methacholine inhalation challenge (MIC), home PEF (peak expiratory flow) monitoring, and skin prick tests (SPT) to common allergens. Asthma was present in 17-22% of 36 index subjects, depending on asthma definition, compared to 11% of 45 controls. Furthermore, FEV% and MEF(25) were lower, and MEF(50) tended to be lower, in index than in control subjects. One or more abnormal lung function results were found in 16 (44%) index subjects, but only in 5 (11%) controls (P < 0.01). Bronchial reactivity (PD20 < 4,900 g methacholine) was demonstrated in 16 (46%) index subjects and 14 (32%) controls (NS). At least one positive SPT result was present in 21 (60%) index subjects; 6 (29%) had asthma (NS vs. nonatopic index subjects); 13 (62%) had abnormal lung function (P < 0.05); and 14 (67%) had bronchial reactivity (P < 0.01). In the logistic regression adjusted for atopy, as defined by SPT positivity, RSV infection in infancy was an independent risk factor for lung function abnormality (one or more abnormal results in FVS; OR, 5.27; 95% CI, 1.60-17.36), and also for decreased FEV% and MEF(50) when these were analyzed separately. However, RSV infection in infancy was not a significant risk factor for asthma or bronchial reactivity. In young adults, lung function abnormalities may be associated with RSV infection which required hospitalization in infancy.  2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

559,"RSV infection in Istanbul: Risk factors and frequency Introduction: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the most common causes of acute respiratory infections in all age groups especially under two years. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency and clinical features of RSV in hospitalized children under two years of age with the diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in our region. Methodology: Between September 2011- May 2013, hospitalized children aged 0-2 years with the diagnosis of viral LRTI, in which nasopharengeal secretions were tested for the presence of the RSV antigen, were included in this prospective study. Results: Among the total of 361 hospitalized children who were investigated for RSV antigen, 138 (38%) were female and 223 (62%) were male. The mean age of the group was 5,75,1 months (0-24 months). RSV antigen in nasopharyngeal secretions was positive in 68 (19%) of 361 patients. RSV infection was detected significantly higher in December and January (p = 0.003). RSV positivity was significantly higher in patients aged under 6 months (p=0.01), with shorter duration of breastfeeding (p = 0.02), low socioeconomic status (p = 0.02), and also born with spontaneous vaginal delivery (p = 0.007). In RSV(+) LRTI group, children were associated with severe disease than RSV (- LRTI group (p = 0.014). Conclusions: Since there is lack of data investigating the frequency and the risk factors of RSV respiratory infections in our region, the present study is important for providing new data. Furthermore, this is the second study investigating the correlation between RSV positivity and meteorological conditions in Turkey.

It consists of the bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV3) genome with substituted human PIV3 F and HN glycoproteins engineered to express RSV F protein. A Phase 1 study of 49 healthy RSV and PIV3 seronegative children 6 to <24 months of age demonstrated an acceptable safety profile at the following doses: 10(4), 10(5) and 10(6)TCID(50). After 3 doses of MEDI-534 at 10(6)TCID(50), administered at 0, 2 and 4 month intervals, 100% of subjects seroresponded to PIV3, whereas only 50% seroresponded to RSV. To investigate the discordance in seroresponse rates, the RSV F transgene and its flanking non-coding nucleotides were sequenced from shed virus recovered from the nasal washes of 24 MEDI-534-vaccinated children. Eleven out of 24 samples contained no nucleotide changes in the analyzed region. The other 13 samples contained mixtures of variant subpopulations. Fifty-five percent exhibited changes in the transcription termination poly A gene sequences of the upstream bPIV3N gene while 21% had variant subpopulations in the RSV F open reading frame that resulted in pre-mature stop codons. Both types of changes are expected to reduce RSV F expression. Evaluation of the administered vaccine by dual immunofluorescence staining showed ~2.5% variants with low or no RSV F expression while single nucleotide primer extension detected ~1% variation at nucleotide 2045 that resulted in a pre-mature translational termination at codon 85. An association between shedding of variants and lower RSV F serological response was observed but it was not possible to establish a definitive clinical significance due to the small number of subjects in this study.  2013 Elsevier Ltd.

561,"Economic analyses of respiratory syncytial virus immunoprophylaxis in high-risk infants: A systematic review Objective: To systematically review all published economic analyses of the only 2 available agents for respiratory syncytial virus immunoprophylaxis in high-risk infants: respiratory syncytial virus immunoglobulin intravenous and palivizumab. Data Sources: Economic evaluations of respiratory syncytial virus immunoprophylactic agents were identified from the MEDLINE and HealthSTAR databases using various combinations of the following search terms: respiratory syncytial virus immunoglobulin intravenous, palivizumab, cost, and cost-effectiveness. The search was limited to articles published in English between January 1, 1990, and August 31, 2001. Additional studies were obtained by searching bibliographies of all relevant identified articles. Study Selection: Only studies that performed an economic analysis of either or both of these agents in an infant population were included. Letters to the editor and commentaries that included informal economic analyses were excluded. Twelve of the 21 identified studies met the selection criteria. Data Extraction: Two of us (S.K.-B. and J.D.) independently reviewed the articles and extracted summary information using a standardized abstraction form, with differences resolved by consensus. Data Synthesis: Estimates ranging from cost savings to considerable incremental costs per hospitalization avoided with use of either agent were observed across studies. Studies comparing the 2 agents reported mixed results about their relative cost-effectiveness in different infant subgroups. The divergent results may be explained by differences in the study methods and assumptions, but they also reflect the poor quality of some of the economic analyses. Conclusion: In light of the issues identified in this review, providers, payers, and health policymakers need to critically appraise and judiciously interpret cost-effectiveness research on these agents.

562,"The Influence of Diagnoses of Specific Viral Infections on In-Hospital Mortality, Length of Stay and Cost in Patients Admitted to Hospital with a Diagnosis of Myocarditis: An Analysis of the National Inpatient Sample Background: The influence of different viral infections in patients with myocarditis is unknown. Myocarditis is an inflammatory disease of heart muscle that is commonly caused by viruses. The impact of different viral infections in patients with myocarditis is unknown. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data between 20162020 in the National Inpatient Sample in the USA to evaluate admissions with myocarditis and concomitant viral infection. The outcomes of in-hospital mortality, length of stay (LoS), and cost, among patients hospitalized for myocarditis was evaluated. Results: A total of 27,050 hospital admissions for myocarditis were included and 6750 (25.0%) had a co-diagnosis of viral infection. Patients with myocarditis and viral infection had significantly higher mortality compared to those without viral infection (23.6% vs. 4.4%, p < 0.001). Viral infection was associated with increased in-hospital mortality (odds ratio (OR) 2.03, 95% CI 1.51 to 2.73, p < 0.001), greater median LoS (7 vs. 3 days, p < 0.001) and median hospitalization cost ($21,445 vs. $11,596, p < 0.001), compared to patients without viral infection. The rate of death was greatest for patients with a diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), viral pneumonia and herpes zoster, respiratory syncytial virus, chronic hepatitis, and influenza which was 36.0%, 34.3%, 27.3%, 21.4%, 20.0%, and 14.5%, respectively. Conclusions: In conclusion, the diagnosis of viral infection is present in one in four patients hospitalized with myocarditis and is correlated with greater mortality, LoS, and in-hospital cost.

564,"Respiratory syncytial virus disease severity in young children Background. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of acute respiratory infections (ARIs) in hospitalized children. Although prematurity and underlying medical conditions are known risk factors, most of these children are healthy, and factors including RSV load and subgroups may contribute to severity. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the role of RSV in ARI severity and determine factors associated with increased RSV-ARI severity in young children. Methods. Children aged <5 years with fever and/or ARI symptoms were recruited from the emergency department (ED) or inpatient settings at Vanderbilt Childrens Hospital. Nasal and/or throat swabs were tested using quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction for common respiratory viruses, including RSV. A severity score was calculated for RSV-positive children. Results. From November 2015 through July 2016, 898 participants were enrolled, and 681 (76%) had at least 1 virus detected, with 191 (28%) testing positive for RSV. RSV-positive children were more likely to be hospitalized, require intensive care unit admission, and receive oxygen compared with children positive for other viruses. Higher viral load, White race, younger age, and higher severity score were independently associated with hospitalization in RSV-positive children. No differences in disease severity were noted between RSV A and RSV B. Conclusions. RSV was associated with increased ARI severity in young children enrolled from the ED and inpatient settings, but no differences in disease severity were noted between RSV A and RSV B. These findings emphasize the need for antiviral therapy and/or preventive measures such as vaccines against RSV in young children.

Six infants were still receiving treatment in Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, while seven infants were readmitted to a Pediatric Intensive Care Unit. Distribution of risk factors (prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, ventilation in newborn period, smoking in the family, unseparated brothers or sisters) in patients were comparable with the data of literature. Eight infants needed head box O2-therapy. No deaths were detected.

Palivizumab guidelines should reflect the latest evidence, in addition to cost-effectiveness and healthcare budgetary considerations. RSV experts from Europe, Canada and Israel undertook a systematic review of the evidence over the last 5 years and developed recommendations regarding prophylaxis in industrialised countries. Almost 400 publications were reviewed. This group recommended palivizumab for: preterm infants (<29 and 31 weeks gestational age [wGA] and 9 and 6 months of age, respectively; high-risk 3235 wGA), former preterm children 24 months with chronic lung disease/bronchopulmonary dysplasia, children 24 months with significant congenital heart disease; and other high-risk populations, such as children 24 months with Down syndrome, pulmonary/neuromuscular disorders, immunocompromised, and cystic fibrosis. Up to 5 monthly doses should be administered over the RSV season. It is our impression that the adoption of these guidelines would help reduce the burden of RSV. (Luna M.S.)

567,"Direct medical costs of RSV-related bronchiolitis hospitalizations in a middle-income tropical country Introduction and objectives: With the objective of making informed decisions on resource allocation, there is a critical need for studies that provide accurate information on hospital costs for treating respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-related bronchiolitis, mainly in middle-income countries (MICs). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the direct medical costs associated with bronchiolitis hospitalizations caused by infection with RSV in Bogota, Colombia. Material and methods: We reviewed the available electronic medical records (EMRs) for all infants younger than two years of age who were admitted to the Fundacion Hospital de La Misericordia with a discharge principal diagnosis of RSV-related bronchiolitis over a 24-month period from January 2016 to December 2017. Direct medical costs of RSV-related bronchiolitis were retrospectively collected by dividing the infants into three groups: those requiring admission to the pediatric ward (PW) only, those requiring admission to the pediatric intermediate care unit (PIMC), and those requiring to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Results: A total of 89 patients with a median (IQR) age of 7.1 (3.112.2) months were analyzed of whom 20 (56.2%) were males. Overall, the median (IQR) cost of infants treated in the PW, in the PIMC, and in the PICU was US$518.0 (217.0768.9) vs. 1305.2 (1051.41492.2) vs. 2749.7 (1372.74159.9), respectively, with this difference being statistically significant (p < 0.001).

568,"Impact of breastfeeding on the incidence and severity of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-associated acute lower respiratory infections in infants: a systematic review highlighting the global relevance of primary prevention Background Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the principal cause of acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) among infants worldwide, and an important cause of morbidity, hospitalisation and mortality. While infants are universally exposed to RSV, most mortality occurs among normal term infants from low-income and middle-income countries. Breastfeeding has been suggested to have a protective effect against RSV infection. This study aims to determine the association of breastfeeding on the frequency and severity of RSV-associated ALRI among infants. Methods A systematic review was conducted using keywords and Medical Subject Headings on MEDLINE, PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE, MedRxiv and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Full-text articles published in English from 2000 to 2021 that studied exclusively or partially breastfed infants who developed RSV-associated ALRI <12 months of age were included. Covidence software-based evidence extraction and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocol guidelines were followed. Quality of evidence was analysed using UK National Service Framework grading and the risk-of-bias assessment using Robvis. Results Among 1368 studies screened, 217 qualified full-text review and 198 were excluded based on pre-agreed criteria. Nineteen articles published from 12 countries that included 16 787 infants from 31 countries (of which 8 middle-income) were retained for analysis. Results indicate that non-breastfeeding practices pose a significant risk for severe RSV-associated ALRI and hospitalisation. Exclusive breastfeeding for >4-6 months significantly lowered hospitalisation, length of stay, supplemental oxygen demand and admission to intensive care units. Conclusion In the context of no effective or standardised treatment for established RSV-associated ALRI, available evidence suggest that breastfeeding is associated with lower frequency and severity of RSV-associated ALRI, based on observational studies of variable grades of evidence and risk-of-bias. With both exclusive and partial breastfeeding benefiting infants who develop RSV-associated ALRI, breastfeeding should be promoted globally as an adjunct primary prevention; in addition to emerging immunoprophylaxis and maternal immunisation strategies.

569,"Respiratory syncytial virus-associated hospitalisations in Australia, 20062015 Objective: To estimate rates of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-associated hospitalisation across the age spectrum, and to identify groups at particular risk of serious RSV-associated disease. Design, setting and participants: Retrospective review of National Hospital Morbidity Database data for all RSV-associated hospitalisations in Australia, 20062015. Main outcomes and measures: RSV-coded hospitalisation rates by age, sex, Indigenous status, jurisdiction, and seasonality (month and year); hospital length of stay; in-hospital deaths. Results: During 20062015, there were 63 814 hospitalisations with an RSV-specific principal diagnostic code; 60 551 (94.9%) were of children under 5 years of age. The hospitalisation rate for children under 5 years was 418 per 100 000 population; for children under 6 months of age it was 2224 per 100 000 population; the highest rate was for infants aged 02 months (2778 per 100 000 population). RSV-coded hospitalisation rates were higher for adults aged 65 or more than for people aged 564 years (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 6.6; 95% CI, 6.27.1), and were also higher for Indigenous Australians than other Australians (IRR, 3.3; 95% CI, 3.23.5). A total of 138 in-hospital deaths were recorded, including 82 of adults aged 65 years or more (59%). Conclusions: Prevention strategies targeting infants, such as maternal or early infant vaccination, would probably have the greatest impact in reducing RSV disease rates. Further characterisation of RSV disease epidemiology, particularly in older adults and Indigenous Australians, is needed to inform health care strategies.

571,"Infants with severe respiratory syncytial virus needed less ventilator time with nasal continuous airways pressure then invasive mechanical ventilation Aim Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) has been proposed as an early first-line support for infants with severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. We hypothesised that infants <6 months with severe RSV would require shorter ventilator support on NCPAP than invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). Methods Retrospective cohort analysis of infants admitted to two paediatric intensive care units, one primarily using NCPAP and one exclusively using IMV, between January 2008 and February 2010. Results We studied 133 (NCPAP n = 89, IMV n = 46) consecutively admitted infants. On admission, disease severity [i.e. Paediatric RISk of Mortality (PRISM) II score (NCPAP 5.1  2.8 vs. IMV 12.2  6.0, p < 0.001) and SpO (2)/F(i)O(2) ratio (NCPAP 309  81 vs. IMV 135  98, p < 0.001)] was higher in the IMV group. NCPAP remained independently associated with shorter ventilatory support (hazard ratio 2.3, 95% CI 1.1-4.7, p = 0.022) after adjusting for PRISM II score, PCO(2), SpO(2)/F(i)O(2) ratio, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and occurrence of clinically suspected secondary bacterial pneumonia.

572,"Predictors of severity and mortality in children hospitalized with respiratory syncytial virus infection in a tropical region Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the leading causes of acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) in infants and young children. Although ALRI is a major public health problem in developing countries located in tropical areas, studies about RSV epidemiology in these regions are scarce. Methods: In a retrospective cohort study, we investigated the epidemiology and predictive variables that reflect disease severity and mortality in young children hospitalized with ALRI due to RSV in Colombia, South-America, during a 2-year period (2009-2011). Results: Of a total of 6,344 children with a diagnosis of ALRI, we selected 2,147 (33.8%) that were positive for RSV. After controlling for pre-existing conditions, we found that independent predictors of severe disease in our population included age <6 months (RR 2.01; CI 95% 1.70-2.38; P < 0.001), prematurity (RR 1.61; CI 95% 1.20-2.17; P = 0.001), congenital heart disease (RR 2.03; CI 95% 1.16-3.54; P = 0.013), and mixed RSV-adenovirus infection (RR 2.09; CI 95% 1.60-2.73; P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis identified that cancer (RR 31.60; CI 95% 5.97-167.13; P < 0.001) is a predictor of mortality in our RSV-infected pediatric population independently of age and other co-morbidities. Conclusions: RSV is an important cause of ALRI in infants and young children living in tropical regions, especially during the rainy season. The identified predictors of severe disease and mortality should be taken into account when planning interventions to reduce the burden of ALRI in young children living in these regions.  2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

573,"Respiratory syncytial virus hospitalization in children in northern Spain Objectives Understanding respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) morbidity may help to plan health care and future vaccine recommendations. We aim to describe the characteristics and temporal distribution of children diagnosed with RSV admitted in a Spanish hospital. Methods Descriptive study for which the hospital discharges of children < 5 years of age with RSV infection were analyzed. The information was extracted from the hospital discharge database of a reference pediatric hospital in northern Spain for the 20102011 to 20142015 RSV seasons. Results Six hundred and forty-seven hospitalizations of children with RSV infection were analyzed, 94% of which occurred between the second week of November and the last week of March. Most children (72%) were under one year of age and 95% were previously healthy infants. Infants born from October to December had the highest risk of hospitalization in the first year of life. The median length of hospital stay of children with and without comorbidities was six and three days, respectively. 6.5% of the hospitalized cases were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit; this percentage was higher among children < 2 months (adjusted odds ratio 4.15; 95% confidence interval: 1.3712.61) or with comorbidities (adjusted odds ratio 4.15; 95% confidence interval: 1.5311.28). The case lethality was 0.3%. Conclusions The risk of hospitalizations for RSV is high during the first year of life and increases among infants born in the fall. Being under two months of age and presenting comorbidities are the main risk factors associated to pediatric intensive care unit admission. (Viguria N., nviguris@cfnavarra.es; Moreno-Galarraga L.)

574,"Intensive care unit admissions and ventilation support in infants with bronchiolitis Objectives: To describe the rate of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, type of ventilation support provided and risk factors for ICU admission in infants with bronchiolitis. Design: Retrospective review of hospital records and Australia and New Zealand Paediatric Intensive Care (ANZPIC) registry data for infants 212 months old admitted with bronchiolitis. Setting: Seven Australian and New Zealand hospitals. These infants were prospectively identified through the comparative rehydration in bronchiolitis (CRIB) study between 2009 and 2011. Results: Of 3884 infants identified, 3589 charts were available for analysis. Of 204 (5.7%) infants with bronchiolitis admitted to ICU, 162 (79.4%) received ventilation support. Of those 133 (82.1%) received non-invasive ventilation (high flow nasal cannula [HFNC] or continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP]) 7 (4.3%) received invasive ventilation alone and 21 (13.6%) received a combination of ventilation modes. Infants with comorbidities such as chronic lung disease (OR 1.6 [95% CI 1.02.6]), congenital heart disease (OR 2.3 [1.53.5]), neurological disease (OR 2.2 [1.24.1]) or prematurity (OR 1.5 [1.02.1]), and infants 26 months of age (OR 1.5 [1.12.0]) were more likely to be admitted to ICU. Respiratory syncitial virus positivity did not increase the likelihood of being admitted to ICU (OR 1.1 [95% CI 0.81.4]). HFNC use changed from 13/53 (24.5% [95% CI 13.738.3]) patient episodes in 2009 to 39/91 (42.9% [95% CI 32.553.7]) patient episodes in 2011. Conclusion: Admission to ICU is an uncommon occurrence in infants admitted with bronchiolitis, but more common in infants with comorbidities and prematurity. The majority are managed with non-invasive ventilation, with increasing use of HFNC. (Oakley E., ed.oakley@rch.org.au; Chong V.; Fry A.; Babl F.E.)

575,"Non-invasive ventilation in infants with severe infection presumably due to respiratory syncytial virus: feasibility and failure criteria Beneficial effect of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) during non invasive ventilation (NIV) has been reported in infants with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, but no study has analyzed the predictors of its failure. Objective: To evaluate the feasibility of NIV and to determine NIV failure criteria. Population and methods: All infants hospitalized in one PICU with presumed RSV infection between 2002 and 2006 were prospectively included. When respiratory support was needed, NIV was first started according to a pre-established protocol. Results: One hundred and one infants, 43 females, 58 males, median age 49 days (range: 10-334), median weight 3,9 kg (range: 2,4-12) were included. RSV infection was confirmed in 84/101. Sixty-seven infants were transported by the paediatric medical transport system, 27 with NIV and 15 with invasive ventilation (IV). Fifteen infants were in IV at admission, 69 received NIV during their PICU stay (12 secondarily requiring IV) and 17 were never ventilated. A significant decrease in PCO(2) with increase in pH was observed within 2 hours of NIV. Parameters associated with NIV failure were apneas, high values of admission PCO(2) and H24 PRISM score. The 17 non-ventilated infants were older and had a lower severity score than those who were ventilated. Conclusion: In infants with RSV and needing respiratory support, NIV represented the sole method of respiratory support in 68% of cases. NIV failure criteria were apneas, high values of admission PCO(2) and H24 PRISM score.  2006 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

576,"Respiratory Syncytial Virus-Associated Mortality among Young Infants in Karachi, Pakistan: A Prospective Postmortem Surveillance Study Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an important cause of infant morbidity and mortality and a potential target for maternal immunization strategies. However, data on the role of RSV in young infant deaths in developing countries are limited. Methods: We conducted a community-based mortality surveillance from August 2018-March 2020 for infants 6 months in Karachi, Pakistan. We tested (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) nasopharyngeal swabs from deceased infants for presence of RSV. We performed verbal autopsies and calculated odds of RSV-associated mortality with 95% CIs and used multivariable logistic regression to evaluate associations. Results: We collected 490 nasopharyngeal specimens from 1280 eligible infant deaths. There were 377/490 (76.9%) live births and 14/377 (3.7%; 95% CI: 1.8-5.6) were RSV positive. Most deaths occurred in neonates (254/377; 67.4%), males (226/377; 59.9%), and respiratory illnesses (206/377; 54.6%). Postneonatal age (10/14, 71.4%; OR: 5.5; 95% CI: 1.7-18.0), respiratory symptoms (12/14, 85.7%; OR: 5.2; 1.2-23.7), and high RSV season (9/14, 64.3%; OR: 4.4; 1.4-13.3) were associated with RSV mortality. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, respiratory symptoms (OR: 6.6; 95% CI: 1.3-32.5), RSV seasonality (6.1; 1.8-20.4), and age (9.2; 2.6-33.1) were significant predictors of RSV-associated mortality. Conclusions: RSV has a significant mortality burden in early infancy in Karachi, Pakistan. Age, RSV seasonality, and respiratory symptoms were significant predictors of RSV-associated mortality. Our findings have implications for clinical management of young infants with cold-like symptoms, policy development, and research regarding maternal immunization against RSV during pregnancy, in resource-constrained, low-income, and vaccine-hesitant populations.

577,"The role of viral co-infections in the severity of acute respiratory infections among children infected with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV): A systematic review and meta-analysis Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the predominant viral cause of childhood pneumonia. Little is known about the role of viral-coinfections in the clinical severity in children infected with RSV. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review of publications comparing the clinical severity between RSV mono-infection and RSV co-infection with other viruses in children under five years (<5y). Clinical severity was measured using the following six clinical outcomes: hospitalisation, length of hospital stay, use of supplemental oxygen, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation and deaths. We summarised the findings by clinical outcome and conducted random-effect meta-analyses, where applicable, to quantitatively synthesize the association between RSV mono-infection/RSV co-infection and the clinical severity. Results: Overall, no differences in the clinical severity were found between RSV mono-infection and RSV co-infection with any viruses, except for the RSV-human metapneumovirus (hMPV) co-infection. RSV-hMPV coinfection was found to be associated with a higher risk of ICU admission (odds ratio (OR) = 7.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.1-25.1; OR after removal of the most influential study was 3.7, 95% CI = 1.1-12.3). We also observed a trend from three studies that RSV-hMPV coinfections were likely to be associated with longer hospital stay. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that RSV-hMPV coinfections might be associated with increased risk for ICU admission in children <5y compared with RSV mono-infection but such association does not imply causation. Our findings do not support the association between RSV coinfections with other viruses and clinical severity but further large-scale investigations are needed to confirm the findings.

578,"Prevention of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection in Healthy Adults by a Single Immunization of Ad26.RSV.preF in a Human Challenge Study Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a significant cause of severe lower respiratory tract disease in children and older adults, but has no approved vaccine. This study assessed the potential of Ad26.RSV.preF to protect against RSV infection and disease in an RSV human challenge model. Methods: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, healthy adults aged 18-50 years were randomized 1:1 to receive 1  1011 vp Ad26.RSV.preF or placebo intramuscularly. Twenty-eight days postimmunization, volunteers were challenged intranasally with RSV-A (Memphis 37b). Assessments included viral load (VL), RSV infections, clinical symptom score (CSS), safety, and immunogenicity. Results: Postchallenge, VL, RSV infections, and disease severity were lower in Ad26.RSV.preF (n = 27) vs placebo (n = 26) recipients: median VL area under the curve (AUC) quantitative real-Time polymerase chain reaction: 0.0 vs 236.0 (P =. 012; predefined primary endpoint); median VL-AUC quantitative culture: 0.0 vs 109; RSV infections 11 (40.7%) vs 17 (65.4%); median RSV AUC-CSS 35 vs 167, respectively. From baseline to 28 days postimmunization, geometric mean fold increases in RSV A2 neutralizing antibody titers of 5.8 and 0.9 were observed in Ad26.RSV.preF and placebo, respectively. Ad26.RSV.preF was well tolerated. Conclusions: Ad26.RSV.preF demonstrated protection from RSV infection through immunization in a human challenge model, and therefore could potentially protect against natural RSV infection and disease.

579,"Association of RSV lower respiratory tract infection and subsequent healthcare use and costs: A Medicaid claims analysis in early-preterm, late-preterm, and full-term infants Objective: Healthcare use and costs within 1 year of a respiratory syncytial virus lower respiratory tract infection (RSV-LRI) among Medicaid early-preterm and late-preterm infants compared with full-term infants were evaluated. Methods: Infants born during 2003-2005 were identified from the Thomson Reuters MarketScan Multi-State Medicaid Database. Infants <1 year of age were grouped based on RSV-LRI and unspecified bronchiolitis/pneumonia (UBP) diagnosis codes and stratified by inpatient or outpatient setting. Infants without RSV-LRI/UBP were selected for comparison. Economic and clinical outcomes were analyzed descriptively; the relationship between RSV-LRI/UBP and costs incurred within 1 year of infection were analyzed using logged ordinary least squares models. Results were stratified by gestational age. Results: Most infants were diagnosed with RSV-LRI/UBP after 90 days of chronologic age. Early-preterm infants had the greatest mean number of inpatient, outpatient, and emergency department visits after an RSV-LRI/UBP episode. The marginal costs among infants with RSV-LRI compared with controls were $34,132 (p<0.001) and $3869 (p=0.115) among inpatients and outpatients, respectively. Among late-preterm infants, the marginal costs were $17,465 (p<0.001) and $2158 (p<0.001) among inpatients and outpatients, respectively. Full-term infants had the lowest marginal costs (inpatients, $9151 [p<0.001]; outpatients, $1428 [p<0.001]). Overall, inpatient infants with RSV-LRI/UBP had higher costs than outpatients, suggesting that increased downstream costs are associated with severity of RSV-LRI/UBP disease. Limitations: Infants with unknown etiology for bronchiolitis were assigned to the UBP group, which may underestimate the costs of the comparison group. Conclusions: The burden of RSV-LRI was substantial among early-preterm Medicaid infants. Costs were also higher among late-preterm relative to full-term infants.  2011 Informa UK Ltd. (Shi N.)

580,"PROPHYLAXIS OF RESPIRATORY SYNCYTIAL VIRUS INFECTION: FROM PALIVIZUMAB TO NIRSEVIMAB, WHAT EVIDENCE? The Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is considered the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in children aged < 2 years. In high-risk children, including preterm infants, or in children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and infants with congenital heart diseases (CHD), RSV infections may lead to severe consequences that often require hospitalizations. The typical seasonality of RSV is going through some changes and as consequence the healthcare management of serious infections is facing some difficulties. In this context and in light of the worldwide economic, political and healthcare debate around treatment of RSV infections, this article aims to inform physicians and healthcare professionals about evidence regarding the two drugs licensed for passive prophylaxis against RSV, namely palivizumab and nirsevimab. According to the 1998 IMpact study, palivizumab administration (5 monthly doses) was able to reduce the incidence of RSV hospitalizations in infants born preterm and in those with BPD. However, over the years, several studies found questionable cost-effectiveness evidence regarding the use of palivizumab in preterm infants born at  29 weeks of gestation. Differently from palivizumab, one single dose of nirsevimab is able to protect over an entire RSV season. This drug was able to reduce hospitalizations and medically attended RSV-associated LRTI in infants born preterm and without comorbidities, but none similar efficacy was found in reducing hospitalizations in healthy infants born at term (born at  35 weeks of gestation). As such, while future interventions in the clinical management of RSV infections and related consequences are warranted, new evidence about nirsevimab and palivizumab use will be essential to define which population will benefit the most from passive prophylaxis.

582,"Respiratory syncytial virus contributes to more severe respiratory morbidity than influenza in children < 2 years during seasonal influenza peaks Purpose: To compare the frequency and the severity of influenza and respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV) infections among children < 24 months hospitalized with respiratory symptoms. Methods: Data from a prospective study conducted during the peak of five influenza seasons in the Province of Quebec, Canada were used. Results: We detected higher frequency of RSV compared to influenza viruses (55.3% vs. 16.3%). Radiologically confirmed pneumonia was significantly more frequent in children with RSV (39%) than those with influenza (18%) and the clinical course was more severe in RSV than influenza-infected children, especially among infants < 3 months. Conclusion: Even during peak weeks of influenza season, we found a higher burden and severity of RSV compared with influenza virus disease in hospitalized children < 24 months.

583,"The impact of childhood RSV infection on children's and parents' quality of life: a prospective multicenter study in Spain Background: Several immunisation candidates against RSV are in late-stage clinical trials. To evaluate the benefits of a potential vaccination programme, both economic and health benefits will be needed. Health benefits are usually measured in Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) loss using standardised questionnaires. However, there are no RSV-specific questionnaires validated for children under 2 years, in whom most RSV episodes occur. Therefore, HRQoL estimates are taken from literature or inadequate tools. We determined HRQoL loss and direct costs due to an RSV episode in children younger than 2 years and their caregivers during a month of follow up, using a new questionnaire administered online. Methods: An observational prospective multicentre surveillance study was conducted in children aged younger than two years. Children were recruited from 8 primary care centres and 1 hospital in the Valencia region and Catalonia (Spain). RSV-positive cases were obtained by immunochromatographic test. HRQoL was assessed using a new ad-hoc 38 item-questionnaire developed. Parents of infected children completed 4 questionnaires at four timepoints (day 0, 7, 14 and 30) after diagnosis. Results: 117 children were enrolled in the study and 86 (73.5%) were RSV +. Median (interquartile range; IQR) scores were 0.52 (0.420.68), 0.65 (0.490.79), 0.82 (0.680.97) and 0.94 (0.811), for days 0, 7, 14 and 30, respectively. Compared to total recovery (Q30), HRQoL loss was 37.5%, 31.5% and 8.9% on days 0, 7 and 14 since diagnosis of the disease. The total median cost per patient (including treatments) was 598.8 (IQR: 359.632425.85). Conclusions: RSV had almost 40% impact on HRQoL during the first week since onset of symptoms and the median cost per episode and patient was about 600. These results represent a substantial input for health-economic evaluations of future RSV-related interventions such as vaccination. (Diez-Gandia E.)

584,"Vaccination against Respiratory Syncytial Virus Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes infection throughout life, with infants, adults who are severely immunocompromised, and the elderly at special risk of developing lower respiratory tract disease, hospitalisation, and death. The burden of severe disease in the elderly is comparable to seasonal influenza, and there remains no effective anti-viral drugs or vaccine for any target population. The development of a vaccine to confer immunity against severe disease is a major global health priority. A multitude of safe and immunogenic vaccine candidates have failed to induce the protective immunity needed for licensure, and in recent years this has included the largest clinical trials of RSV vaccines in history. The obstacles to vaccine development in elderly populations include an incomplete understanding of the immune responses needed for protection, the effect of aging on induction and maintenance of immunity (natural and vaccine induced immunity), and the high rate of co-morbid disease in older adults. Recent advances in structural biology, new biological platforms for antigen delivery, and insights from experimental challenge models mark the latest developments in over 50 years of research. This continues to be an active and evolving field of scientific discovery with renewed hope for a vaccine in the future.

Respiratory virus infection (RVI) in pediatric solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients poses a significant risk; however, the epidemiology and effects of an RVI after pediatric SOT in the era of current molecular diagnostic assays are unclear. Methods. A retrospective observational cohort of pediatric SOT recipients (January 2010 to June 2013) was assembled from 9 US pediatric transplant centers. Charts were reviewed for RVI events associated with hospitalization within 1 year after the transplant. An RVI diagnosis required respiratory symptoms and detection of a virus (ie, human rhinovirus/enterovirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, coronavirus, and/or respiratory syncytial virus). The incidence of RVI was calculated, and the association of baseline SOT factors with subsequent pulmonary complications and death was assessed. Results. Of 1096 pediatric SOT recipients (448 liver, 289 kidney, 251 heart, 66 lung, 42 intestine/multivisceral), 159 (14.5%) developed RVI associated with hospitalization within 12 months after their transplant. RVI occurred at the highest rates in intestine/ abdominal multivisceral (38%), thoracic (heart/lung) (18.6%), and liver (15.6%) transplant recipients and a lower rate in kidney (5.5%) transplant recipients. RVI was associated with younger median age at transplant (1.72 vs 7.89 years; P < .001) and among liver or kidney transplant recipients with the receipt of a deceased-donor graft compared to a living donor (P = .01). The all-cause and attributable case-fatality rates within 3 months of RVI onset were 4% and 0%, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression models revealed that age was independently associated with increased risk for a pulmonary complication (odds ratio, 1.24 [95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.51]) and that receipt of an intestine/multivisceral transplant was associated with increased risk of all-cause death (odds ratio, 24.54 [95% confidence interval, 1.69-327.96]). Conclusions. In this study, hospital-associated RVI was common in the first year after pediatric SOT and associated with younger age at transplant. All-cause death after RVI was rare, and no definitive attributable death occurred. (Danziger-Isakov L., Lara.Danziger-Isakov@cchmc.org; Paulsen G.)

586,"Time trend and seasonality in medically attended respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections in US children aged 0-5 years, January 2010-January 2023 Objective The long-term time trend and seasonality variations of first-time medically attended respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections among young children are unknown. We aim to examine the time trend of medically attended first-time RSV infections among young children in the USA from January 2010 through January 2023. Design This is a population-based cohort study using electronic health records (EHRs). Monthly incidence rate of medically attended first-time RSV infection (cases per 10 000 000 person-days). A time-series regression model was used to model and predict time trends and seasonality. Setting Multicenter and nationwide TriNetX Network in the USA. Participants The study population comprised children aged 0-5 years who had medical visits during the period of January 2010 to January 2023. Results The data included 29 013 937 medical visits for children aged 0-5 years (46.5% girls and 53.5% boys) from January 2010 through January 2023. From 2010 through 2019, the monthly incidence rate of first-time medically attended RSV infection in children aged 0-5 years followed a consistent seasonal pattern. Seasonal patterns of medically attended RSV infections were significantly disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, the seasonal variation disappeared with a peak incidence rate of 20 cases per 1 000 000 person-days, a decrease of 97.4% from the expected peak rate (rate ratio or RR: 0.026, 95% CI 0.017 to 0.040). In 2021, the seasonality returned but started 4 months earlier, lasted for 9 months, and peaked in August at a rate of 753 cases per 1 000 000 person-days, a decrease of 9.6% from the expected peak rate (RR: 0.90, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.99). In 2022, the seasonal pattern is similar to prepandemic years but reached a historically high rate of 2182 cases per 10 000 000 person-days in November, an increase of 143% from the expected peak rate (RR: 2.43, 95% CI 2.25 to 2.63). The time trend and seasonality of the EHR-based medically attended RSV infections are consistent with those of RSV-associated hospitalisations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) survey-based surveillance system. Conclusion The findings show the disrupted seasonality during the COVID-19 pandemic and a historically high surge of paediatric RSV cases that required medical attention in 2022. Our study demonstrates the potential of EHRs as a cost-effective alternative for real-time pathogen and syndromic surveillance of unexpected disease patterns including RSV infection.

587,"Respiratory syncytial virus infection and palivizumab: Are families receiving accurate information? The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of information provided by medical practitioners to families regarding the efficacy and limitations of prophylaxis with palivizumab for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in infants. A single-question survey was distributed to medical practitioners who described themselves as having both prescribed palivizumab for infants and discussed the effects of the drug with families. Responses were anonymous and returned immediately after reviewing the survey question. Respondents were requested to choose the answer that most closely resembled their understanding of palivizumab effects on the degree of illness and severity of RSV infection. All surveys distributed were completed and answers assessed by medical specialty. A total of 456 surveys were returned. Neonatologists and pediatricians accounted for the majority of responses. The answer that most closely reflects the medical literature, that palivizumab will decrease hospitalization but have no effect on need for mechanical intubation or mortality, was chosen only 2% of the time. Families are not receiving accurate information regarding the expected potential benefits and limitations of immunoprophylaxis with palivizumab. This is a very expensive drug with unclear cost-effectiveness. If changes are to be made to current recommendations as to use of palivizumab, families must receive informed consent that accurately reflects the literature.  2010 by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.

588,"Incidence and cost of hospitalizations for bronchiolitis and respiratory syncytial virus infections in the autonomous Community of Valencia in Spain (2001 and 2002) Objective: To assess the incidence and costs of hospitalizations for bronchiolitis and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections the Autonomous Community of Valencia, Spain. Methods: The minimum data set (MDS) of the Autonomous Community of Valencia was analyzed. Hospital discharges with the codes for bronchiolitis (with or without etiologic determination) and RSV infections occurring in 2001 and 2002 in children less than 2 years old were included. Second cases of bronchiolitis and RSV infections of possible nosocomial origin occurring during prolonged hospitalization were excluded. The average cost of hospitalization in a pediatric ward was estimated at  310.30 per day. To calculate the incidence, we assumed that 95 % of the hospitals reported to the MDS; the population used was that of the National Census, 2001. Results: A total of 3,705 hospitalizations were obtained, of which 3,507 were coded as bronchiolitis and 42.2 % of these were RSV-positive. Virological assessment varied greatly among hospitals. Hospitalizations were most frequent between October and April, with no differences between the two years. The incidence of bronchiolitis hospitalization was 40.2 cases/1000 children < 1 year/year, with an average annual cost of 3,618 thousand euros. Conclusions: The cost of bronchiolitis hospitalizations is high. Microbiological investigation is low in some hospitals, leading the economic impact of RSV on society to be underestimated.

589,"Immunopathogenesis of respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis Background. The objective of this study was to elucidate the relation between respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection and cytokine/chemokine concentrations, as well as the impact that these factors have on the severity of bronchiolitis. Methods. Children <24 months old who presented to the emergency department with clinical symptoms of bronchiolitis were prospectively enrolled in the study. Nasal-wash samples were analyzed to identify viral pathogens and to quantify RSV and cytokine/chemokine concentrations. Severe cases of disease were defined as those requiring hospitalization, and severity was further determined on the basis of the duration of supplemental-oxygen and/or intravenous-fluid therapy. Results. A total of 101 children were enrolled, 63 of whom were infected with RSV and 13 of whom were infected with other respiratory viruses; in 22 children, no virus was detected. RSV bronchiolitis was associated with a greater inflammatory response than was non-RSV bronchiolitis, although RSV infection was not associated with more-severe disease. Levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, interferon (IFN)-, and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 were significantly inversely correlated with the duration of supplemental-oxygen therapy. Conclusion. The robust inflammatory response associated with RSV infection does not contribute to the severity of RSV bronchiolitis any more than it contributes to the severity of non-RSV bronchiolitis. Elevated levels of proinflammatory mediators IL-6, IL-8, IFN-, and MIP-1, as well as of the regulatory cytokine IL-10, may be protective against hypoxia in bronchiolitis.  2007 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

590,"High mortality in patients with influenza A pH1N1 2009 admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit: A predictive model of mortality OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical characteristics and outcome of patients admitted to pediatric intensive care with influenza A (pH1N1) 2009 in Argentina. DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. SETTING: Thirteen pediatric intensive care units in Argentina. SUBJECTS: One hundred and forty-two patients with confirmed or suspected influenza A (H1N1). INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We included 142 critically ill patients. The median age was 19 months (range, 2-110 months) with 39% of the patients <24 months of age. Ninety-nine patients (70%) had an underlying disease. Influenza A (pH1N1) 2009 infection was confirmed in 90 patients and the remaining 52 had a positive direct immunofluorescence assay for influenza A. The median length of stay in the pediatric intensive care unit was 12 days (range, 2-52 days). One hundred eighteen patients (83%) received invasive mechanical ventilation and 19 patients were treated with noninvasive ventilation; however, seven of the patients receiving noninvasive ventilation later needed mechanical ventilation. Sixty-eight patients died (47%) with the most frequent cause refractory hypoxemia. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that age <24 months (odds ratio, 2.87; 2.35-3.93), asthma (odds ratio, 1.34; 1.20-2.91), and respiratory coinfection with respiratory syncytial virus (odds ratio, 2.92; 1.20-4.10) were associated with higher mortality. As expected, mechanical ventilation and treatment with inotropes were also associated with increased mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The mortality of children admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit with 2009 pH1N1 influenza was high (47%) in our population. Age <24 months, asthma, respiratory coinfection, need of mechanical ventilation, and treatment with inotropes were predictors of poorer outcome.  2012 The Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies.

591,"Burden of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection during the First Year of Life Background: Although many infants with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection are hospitalized, most infants are treated as outpatients. Limited data are available on the burden of RSV in outpatient infants. Methods: In a prospective study, we enrolled 431 newborn infants and followed them up for a 10-month period (September-June). During each respiratory illness, we examined the infants and obtained nasopharyngeal specimens for the detection of RSV. The parents completed daily symptom diaries throughout the study. Results: Among 408 active participants, the seasonal incidence rate of RSV illness was 328.4 per 1000 (95% confidence interval [CI], 275.2-389.0). Infants with 1 sibling had a 1.9-fold higher incidence of RSV illness than those without siblings (95% CI, 1.3-2.8; P<.001). Acute otitis media developed in 103 (76.9%) of 134 infants with RSV infection, and 95 (70.9%) were treated with antibiotics. Nine infants with RSV (6.7%) were hospitalized, for a seasonal incidence rate of RSV hospitalization of 22.1 per 1000 (95% CI, 10.1-41.9). Conclusions: The outpatient burden of RSV is heavy on infants during the first year of life. Acute otitis media is a frequent complication of RSV, and it should be included in cost-effectiveness analyses of prevention or treatment of RSV infections in infants.

592,"Mortality rates of human Metapneumovirus and respiratory syncytial virus lower respiratory tract infections in hematopoietic cell transplantation recipients Human metapneumovirus (HMPV), a common respiratory virus, can cause severe disease in pre- and post-hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) recipients. We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis in HCT patients with HMPV (n= 23) or respiratory syncytial virus (n= 23) detected in bronchoalveolar lavage samples by reverse transcription PCR between 2006 and 2011 to determine disease characteristics and factors associated with outcome. Mortality rates at 100 days were 43% for both HMPV and respiratory syncytial virus lower respiratory tract disease. Steroid therapy, oxygen requirement >2 L or mechanical ventilation, and bone marrow as cell source were significant risk factors for overall and virus-related mortality in multivariable models, whereas the virus type was not. The presence of centrilobular/nodular radiographic infiltrates was a possible protective factor for mechanical ventilation. Thus, HMPV lower respiratory tract disease is associated with high mortality in HCT recipients. Earlier detection in combination with new antiviral therapy is needed to reduce mortality among HCT recipients.  2013 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.

593,"Genetic predisposition of RSV infection-related respiratory morbidity in preterm infants The aim of this study was to assess whether prematurely born infants have a genetic predisposition to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection-related respiratory morbidity. One hundred and forty-six infants born at less than 36 weeks of gestation were prospectively followed. Nasopharygeal aspirates were obtained on every occasion the infants had a lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) regardless of need for admission. DNA was tested for 11 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Chronic respiratory morbidity was assessed using respiratory health-related questionnaires, parent-completed diary cards at a corrected age of 1 year and review of hospital notes. Lung function was measured at a post menstrual age (PMA) of 36 weeks and corrected age of 1 year. A SNP in ADAM33 was associated with an increased risk of developing RSV LRTIs, but not with significant differences in 36-week PMA lung function results. SNPs in several genes were associated with increased chronic respiratory morbidity (interleukin 10 (IL10), nitric oxide synthase 2A (NOS2A), surfactant protein C (SFTPC), matrix metalloproteinase 16 (MMP16) and vitamin D receptor (VDR)) and reduced lung function at 1 year (MMP16, NOS2A, SFTPC and VDR) in infants who had had RSV LRTIs. Conclusions: Our results suggest that prematurely born infants may have a genetic predisposition to RSV LRTIs and subsequent respiratory morbidity which is independent of premorbid lung function.  2014 Springer-Verlag.

595,"Diminished lung function, RSV infection, and respiratory morbidity in prematurely born infants Background: Diminished lung function appears to be a risk factor for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection/bronchiolitis in term born infants. Aims: To determine if diminished lung function prior to neonatal unit discharge was associated with subsequent symptomatic RSV lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) and respiratory morbidity in prematurely born infants. Methods: Of 39 infants in a tertiary neonatal intensive care unit (median gestational age 28 weeks, range 23-31), 20 had bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Lung function (compliance and resistance of the respiratory system (C(rs) and R (rs)) and functional residual capacity (FRC)) was measured on the neonatal unit at 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA). Following neonatal unit discharge, nasopharyngeal aspirates were obtained on every occasion, at home or in hospital, an infant had an LRTI. RSV was identified by immunofluorescence and/or culture. Results: The 15 infants who suffered a symptomatic RSV LRTI had a higher mean R(rs) and suffered more wheeze at follow up than the rest of the cohort. Regression analysis showed that a high R(rs) was significantly associated with a symptomatic RSV LRTI; significant factors for cough were a high R(rs) and a symptomatic RSV LRTI, and for wheeze were a high R(rs). Conclusion: Prematurely born infants, who had a symptomatic RSV LRTI and/or respiratory morbidity at follow up, had worse lung function prior to neonatal unit discharge.

596,"Characteristics, complications, and mortality of respiratory syncytial virus compared with influenza infections in hospitalized adult patients in Thailand Introduction: RSV is increasingly recognized in adults. An improved understanding of clinical manifestations and complications may facilitate diagnosis and management. Methods: This was a retrospective study of hospitalized patients aged  18 years with RSV or influenza infection at Siriraj hospital, Thailand between January 2014 and December 2017. Results: RSV and/or influenza were detected by RT-PCR in 570 (20.1%) of 2836 patients. After excluding patients coinfected with influenza A and B (n = 5), and with influenza and RSV (n = 3), 141 (5.0%) RSV and 421 (14.8%) influenza patients were analyzed. Over the study period, RSV circulated during the rainy season and peaked in September or October. Patients with RSV were older than patients with influenza and presented significantly less myalgia and fever, but more wheezing. Pneumonia was the most common complication, occurring in 110 (78.0%) of RSV cases and in 295 (70.1%) of influenza cases (p = 0.069). Cardiovascular complications were found in 30 (21.3%) RSV and 96 (22.8%) influenza (p = 0.707), and were reasons for admission in 15 (10.6%) RSV and 50 (11.9%) influenza. The in-hospital mortality rates for RSV (17; 12.1%) and influenza (60; 14.3%) were similar (p = 0.512). Conclusions: In Thailand, RSV is a less common cause of adult hospitalization than influenza, but pulmonary and cardiovascular complications, and mortality are similar. Clinical manifestations cannot reliably distinguish between RSV and influenza infection; laboratory-confirmed diagnosis is needed. (Chuaychoo B., benjamas.chu@mahidol.ac.th; Rattanasaengloet K.)

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children under one year of age worldwide. Records indicative of RSV cases were pulled from The Louisiana Inpatient Hospital Discharge Data based on RSV diagnosis codes to describe the burden of RSV infections in Louisiana from 1999 to 2010. Two thousand to three thousand hospitalized RSV cases occurred each year, with rates ranging from 37.2 to 71.4 hospitalizations per 100,000 population and the majority of cases (79%) being diagnosed with bronchiolitis. The vast majority of cases occurred in children under one year of age, and within that group, 44% of the cases occurred in children ages 0 to 3 months. The RSV season was found to occur from November to March, and immunoprophylaxis for high-risk infants should be given according to that season.

600,"Decreased lung function precedes severe respiratory syncytial virus infection and post-respiratory syncytial virus wheeze in term infants It is unknown why respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes mild disease in some children and severe disease, requiring hospitalisation, in others. We aimed to assess whether diminished premorbid lung function in healthy term infants predisposes to hospitalisation during RSV bronchiolitis, and to post-RSV wheeze. In a prospective birth cohort study of unselected term healthy children, neonatal lung function was measured before the age of 2 months (n=2133). From birth through the first year of life, respiratory symptoms were recorded in a diary, and general practitioner consultations and hospitalisations were documented. In a subgroup (n=417) repeated nose and throat swabs were collected for PCR to detect RSV infections. Median neonatal respiratory system compliance (Crs) was significantly lower (41.2 versus 47.4 mLkPa<sup>-1</sup>, p=0.03) and resistance (R rs) was higher (8.2 versus 6.3 kPas L<sup>-1</sup>, p=0.10) in hospitalised RSV patients (n=18) compared with nonhospitalised RSV-positive infants (n=84).

601,"Guidelines for respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis. An update Epidemiological studies performed by the IRIS study group in the last two respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) seasons found that the hospitalization rates for RSV in premature infants born before or in week 32 of gestation were 13.4 % and 13.1 %, respectively. Of these, 18 % and 25 % of the infants were admitted to the intensive care unit. Currently available information demonstrates the efficacy of RSV monoclonal antibodies (palivizumab) and the absence of major adverse effects. To date, there are no data that indicate the need to modify the guidelines for RSV prophylaxis in premature infants published in 2000. (Carbonell-Estrany X.; Quero Jimenez J.)

We report a case of life threatening bilateral tension pneumothorax complicating bronchiolitis in an infant. A 2-month-old infant girl suffered from respiratory failure due to severe RSV bronchiolitis. While on hand ventilation (hand bagging) through endotracheal tube in the Accident & Emergency Department, she developed cyanosis and bradycardia because of bilateral tension pneumothorax. She responded to cardiopulmonary resuscitation and tube thoracostomy. She was supported by mechanical ventilation with the strategy of permissive hypercapnia in paediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Her condition improved uneventfully and she recovered without long-term adverse sequelae. (Hui Y.W.; Choy W.H.; Chan K.Y.)

The study was performed between 14/10/2015 and 19/03/2016 on nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) collected from children consulting at the PED of the University Hospital of Saint-Etienne for bronchiolitis (RSV detection) or flu-like syndrome (influenzaviruses A/B detection). NPAs were tested 24/7 at the PED with the RDT and then sent to the Infectious Agents Department for routine analyses, first by immunofluorescence assay (IFA), then by nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) considered as the gold standard in case of discrepancy between RDT and IFA results. For RSV detection, 205 NPAs was analyzed; the overall concordance between RDT and routine assays was of 97.6% (200/205). The sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), negative predictive value (NPV) and positive predictive value (PPV) were of 97.6% (160/164), 97.6% (40/41), 90.9% (40/44) and 99.4% (160/161), respectively. A total of 419 NPA was tested for influenzaviruses. For influenzavirus A, the overall concordance was of 98.8% (414/419); Se, Sp, NPV and PPV were of 100% (41/41), 98.7% (373/378), 100% (373/373) and 89.1% (41/46), respectively. For influenzavirus B, the overall concordance was of 97.9% (410/419); Se, Sp, NPV and PPV were of 96.6% (172/178), 98.8% (238/241), 97.5% (238/244) and 98.3% (172/175), respectively.

604,"Direct medical cost assessment in the <2 years-old hospitalized RSV(+)LRTI patients Objective: This multi-center study aimed to assess the direct medical costs in patients aged between 0-2 year-old admitted to the hospital due to lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), which was identified as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in 3 big pediatric hospitals for a year. Material and Methods: During one-year period, <2-year-old LRTI patients with RSV(+) and RSV(-)were included in the study conducted in 3 different pediatric hospitals. RSV was diagnosed with the detection of nasopharyngeal antigen. Direct medical costs (hospitalization, laboratory and treatment costs) were removed from the hospitals bills. Antibiotic costs of the antibiotic-treated cases were calculated independently. The indirect costs in the study were not considered and evaluated. Results: In the study, 10% of the total inpatients aged <2-years were hospitalized with LRTI. 38% (254/671) of patients with LRTI, 41% (151/368) of those with acute bronchiolitis and 34% (103/303) of those with pneumonia were RSV positive. 4% of all hospitalized cases were RSV(+)LRTI; nearly 88% of the RSV(+)LRTIs and 92% of RSV(-)LRTIs received antibiotics (p=0.09). 10% of the RSV(+)LRTIs and 13% of RSV(-)RLTIs were hospitalized in the intensive care units (p=0.19). It was found that the total direct medical hospitalization costs including the antibiotics including the RSV(+)LRTI median values were 334 (range: 6-21545) (mean+SD: 910226) $, antibiotic costs median value was 24 (0-7691) (103548) $, and non-antibiotic median value was 301 (6-18767) (7891826) $. It was found that these values in the RSV(-)LRTI, on the other hand, 358 (5-31938) (10282741) $, 33 (0-33333) (90236) $, 320 (5-31767) (9112625) $ respectively. 48% of RSV(+)LRTI cases were aged between 0-3 months and it was found that the average cost per case was in this age group was two times higher than the 4-6 months and 7-11 months age group (on average 1068, 508 and 352$ respectively). It was found that the hospitalization costs of the total of 254 RSV(+) patients were $ 231,178 and the costs of the 417 RSV(-)patients were $ 428,991. Conclusion: According to these results, RSV infections still constitute a significant part of RLTIs at <2 years of age in our country and cause an important epidemiological and economic disease burden.

605,"Vaccination strategies against respiratory syncytial virus Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of US infant hospitalization. Additionally, RSV is responsible for 10,000 deaths annually among the elderly across the United States, and accounts for nearly as many hospitalizations as influenza. Currently, several RSV vaccine candidates are under development to target different age groups. To evaluate the potential effectiveness of agespecific vaccination strategies in averting RSV incidence, we developed a transmission model that integrates data on daily infectious viral load and changes of behavior associated with RSV symptoms. Calibrating to RSV weekly incidence rates in Texas, California, Colorado, and Pennsylvania, we show that in all states considered, an infected child under 5 y of age is more than twice as likely as a person over 50 y of age to transmit the virus. Geographic variability in the effectiveness of a vaccination program across states arises from interplay between seasonality patterns, population demography, vaccination uptake, and vaccine mechanism of action. Regardless of these variabilities, our analysis showed that allocating vaccine to children under 5 y of age would be the most efficient strategy per dose to avert RSV in both children and adults. Furthermore, due to substantial indirect protection, the targeting of children is even predicted to reduce RSV in the elderly more than directly vaccinating the elderly themselves. Our results can help inform ongoing clinical trials and future recommendations on RSV vaccination.

Study design: Pooled analysis of data (n = 1218) from Spain, Germany, France and Italy. Result: RSV hospitalised infants overall had a significantly higher birth weight than non-hospitalised infants (2.24 versus 2.14 kg; p < 0.001) for both males (2.25 versus 2.18 kg; p = 0.049) and females (2.22 versus 2.11 kg, p = 0.007).

609,"Palivizumab for respiratory syncytial virus disease Aim. Palivizumab (Synagis, Abbott) is a humanized monoclonal antibody of IgG class currently used for prophylaxis of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. It neutralises the protein F of RSV, which allows the virus to penetrate inside the host cell and subsequently to form syncytia, causing clinical manifestations. Based on that, our aim was to assess if an early administration of palivizumab during RSV infection could positively modify the infection course, hence providing a therapeutic effect. Methods. The study included eight infants hospitalized with a case history suggestive of severe RSV which made the use of oxygen therapy and, in five cases, mechanical ventilation necessary. The diagnosis was confirmed by the isolation of the virus in the nasopharyngeal aspirate; for all of them informed consent was obtained by the parents. All infants were treated with palivizumab (15 mg/kg i.m. in a single dose). Results. All infants showed a significant clinical improvement and a fast recovery, with a consequent precocious dismissal. After 7 days, 6 infants had a negative nasopharyngeal aspirate. Palivizumab administration at the onset of RSV infection seems to work as a therapy. Conclusion. The limited number of the patients does not allow to formulate definitive conclusions but the present study suggests the usefulness of verifying these positive results through randomised controlled studies.

610,"The impact of prophylaxis on paediatric intensive care unit admissions for RSV infection: A retrospective, single-centre study Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infections and hospitalizations in children aged <2 years. The aim of this retrospective, single-centre study was to examine the characteristics of patients admitted to a paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with RSV infection following the implementation of a RSV prophylaxis programme. Electronic hospital medical records of all PICU admissions for RSV infection were searched from 2003 to 2009. Data on baseline demographics, underlying disease, criteria for hospitalization, respiratory diagnosis and management, complications and palivizumab prophylaxis were collected. A total of 181 patients were admitted with RSV infection, accounting for 5.7% of all admissions. Eighty-four percent were 2 years of age. Majority (70.2%) had no underlying medical illness, and 79.6% received antibiotics as part of their medical treatment. Comparison of children aged 2 years and those >2 years revealed that fewer of the younger cohort (20.4% versus 79.3%; p<0.001) had an underlying medical condition. RSV infection occurred in 3.3% (n=6) children who had received palivizumab prophylaxis, and there were two deaths. The results indicate that >88% of all PICU admissions would not qualify for RSV prophylaxis under our established guidelines and 66% of the children aged 2 years were >36 weeks gestation and are not currently targeted for prophylaxis. The number of high-risk infants admitted to PICU with RSV infection has likely plateaued, and further reductions in admission rates may only be realised with the use of universal, vaccine immunization programmes.  2010 Springer-Verlag.

611,"Passive immunoprophylaxis against respiratory syncytial virus in children: Where are we now? Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) represents the main cause of acute respiratory tract infections in children worldwide and is the leading cause of hospitalization in infants. RSV infection is a self-limiting condition and does not require antibiotics. However hospitalized infants with clinical bronchiolitis often receive antibiotics for fear of bacteria coinfection, especially when chest radiography is performed due to similar radiographic appearance of infiltrate and atelectasis. This may lead to unnecessary antibiotic prescription, additional cost, and increased risk of development of resistance. Despite the considerable burden of RSV bronchiolitis, to date, only symptomatic treatment is available, and there are no commercially available vaccines. The only licensed passive immunoprophylaxis is palivizumab. The high cost of this monoclonal antibody (mAb) has led to limiting its prescription only for high-risk children: infants with chronic lung disease, congenital heart disease, neuromuscular disorders, immunodeficiencies, and extreme preterm birth. Nevertheless, it has been shown that the majority of hospitalized RSV-infected children do not fully meet the criteria for immune prophylaxis. While waiting for an effective vaccine, passive immune prophylaxis in children is mandatory. There are a growing number of RSV passive immunization candidates under development intended for RSV prevention in all infants. In this review, we describe the state-of-the-art of palivizumabs usage and summarize the clinical and preclinical trials regarding the development of mAbs with a better cost-effectiveness ratio.

612,"Respiratory syncytial virus vaccine: A systematic overview with emphasis on respiratory syncytial virus subunit vaccines Objective: To explore whether RSV vaccines are efficacious in preventing respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory infection (LRI). Methods: Randomized clinical trials were sought through Medline using the following search terms: 'RSV' or 'RSV infection' and 'viral vaccine'. Randomized controlled trials in adults or children that provided data on clinical outcomes (RSV LRIs, all LRI, all RSV infections) were included. Control groups could receive placebo or another vaccine. Qualitative assessment and summary data were obtained independently by three authors and summarized on a pre-printed form. Where disagreements occurred, the studies were reviewed by all investigators. These disagreements were mainly clerical, such as misinterpretations of the table or text or transcription errors. Consensus was obtained for all studies. Summary statistics consists of relative risk (RR) and number needed to vaccinate to prevent the above outcomes. Results: Because of the outcomes examined, only studies of a purified F protein subunit (PFP) vaccine were included in the meta-analysis. These clinical trials were phase I studies to determine vaccine safety rather than efficacy. Efficacy of PFP-1 or PFP-2 vaccine were analyzed together. A statistically significant RR in overall number of RSV infections was observed RR 0.55 (95%CI, 0.35, 0.88), but the test of heterogeneity was significant raising doubts about the validity of this conclusion. The effect of vaccination on RSV LRI did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions: RSV subunit vaccines were found to reduce the overall incidence of all RSV infections. However, RSV subunit vaccines must be tested in large field trials because of concerns about the appropriateness of pooling, the risk of publication bias and the fact that the clinically important outcome of RSV LRI was not reduced.  2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

613,"Hospitalizations for respiratory syncytial virus among adults in the United States, 1997-2012 Background. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an established cause of serious lower respiratory disease in children, but the burden in adults is less well studied. Methods. We conducted a retrospective study of hospitalizations among adults 20 years from the 1997-2012 National Inpatient Sample. Trends in RSV admissions were described relative to unspecified viral pneumonia admissions. Hospitalization severity indicators were compared among immunocompromised RSV, non-immunocompromised RSV, and influenza admissions. Results. An estimated 28 237 adult RSV hospitalizations occurred, compared with 652 818 influenza hospitalizations; 34% were immunocompromised individuals. Respiratory syncytial virus and influenza patients had similar age, gender, and race distributions, but RSV was more often diagnosed in urban teaching hospitals (73.0% for RSV vs 34.6% for influenza) and large hospitals (71.9% vs 56.4%). Respiratory syncytial virus hospitalization rates increased from 1997 to 2012, particularly for those 60, increasing from 0.5 to 4.6 per 100 000, whereas unspecified pneumonia admission rates decreased significantly (P <.001). Immunocompromised patients with RSV hospitalization had significantly higher inpatient mortality (P =.013), use of mechanical ventilation (P =.016), mean length of stay (LOS) (P <.001), and mean cost (P <.001) than non-immunocompromised RSV hospitalizations. Overall, RSV hospitalizations were more severe than influenza hospitalizations (6.2% mortality for RSV vs 3.0% for influenza, 16.7% vs 7.2% mechanical ventilation, mean LOS of 6.0 vs 3.6 days, and mean cost of $38 828 vs $14 519). Conclusions. Respiratory syncytial virus hospitalizations in adults are increasing, likely due to increasing recognition and diagnosis. The burden of RSV in adults deserves attention. Although there are fewer hospitalizations than influenza, those that are diagnosed are on average more severe. (Pastula S.T., sue@epidstat.com; Coalson J.; Jiang X.; Fryzek J.)

614,"RSV prophylaxis in premature infants Infants born prematurely before 37 weeks of gestational age (G A) have particular anatomical, immunological and metabolic characteristics that predispose them, even in the absence of diseases at birth, to severe morbidity. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of hospitalization for lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in the first year of life, as well as an important cause of respiratory outcomes as recurrent wheezing in industrialized countries or mortality in developing countries. Prematurity is an important risk factor for hospitalization for severe RSV disease, but epidemiological, environmental and demographic risk factors also play a role in RSV infection. Currently, there is no effective antiviral therapy for the treatment of RSV infection, nor the possibility of using maternal immunization or vaccination of children to prevent infection, although numerous preclinical and clinical studies are still ongoing. Passive immunization with palivizumab has been shown to be safe and effective in preventing RSV hospitalization in children at greater risk of contracting a serious infection. Costs associated with palivizumab prophylaxis and its monthly intramuscularly administration has prompted many health institutions of different countries to implement specific recommendations, with the aim of protecting at risk infants for whom RSV infection is likely to cause serious illness or death. The cost-effectiveness ratio of prophylaxis, related to reduce hospitalization costs and the impact of the burden of RSV disease worldwide, greatly affects the drafting and the adoption of specific recommendations and the adherence to them, concerning the passive immunization with palivizumab.

615,"Clinical and Socioeconomic Burden of Respiratory Syncytial Virus in Iceland Introduction: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a very common pathogen, causes variable disease severity. In addition to considerable clinical burden on children, their families and healthcare facilities, RSV infections in children also carry significant direct and indirect socioeconomic burden. Methods: We analyzed data from 5 consecutive RSV seasons (2015-2020) and used virologically confirmed RSV infections and age <5 years as case definition. Clinical information was retrieved from electronic patient records. Costs were estimated by assuming an annual 30% attack rate and a combination of direct medical costs and calculations of societal costs of lost productivity. Results: A total of 716 children younger than 5 years of age had confirmed RSV infection of which 254 needed hospitalizations, most of whom were previously healthy. The median length of admission was 3.6 days and 13 patients needed intensive care. The hospital admission incidence rate was 2.5/1000 children/year, but 9.1 for children younger than 1 years of age. The total annual cost of RSV was estimated at 4.3 million, of which 10% was direct healthcare costs. Discussion: The clinical and socioeconomic disease burden of RSV in Iceland is substantial despite slightly lower hospital admission rates than other high-income countries. The prevention of RSV in young children, either through maternal or infant vaccination, has the potential to decrease both clinical and financial impact of the annual epidemics.

616,"Respiratory syncytial virus: diagnosis, prevention and management Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is responsible for a large burden of disease globally and can present as a variety of clinical syndromes in children of all ages. Bronchiolitis in infants under 1 year of age is the most common clinical presentation hospitalizing 24.2 per 1000 infants each year in the United Kingdom. RSV has been shown to account for 22% of all episodes of acute lower respiratory tract infection in children globally. RSV hospitalization, that is, RSV severe disease, has also been associated with subsequent chronic respiratory morbidity. Routine viral testing in all children is not currently recommended by the United Kingdom National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) or the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidance and management is largely supportive. There is some evidence for the use of ribavirin in severely immunocompromised children. Emphasis is placed on prevention of RSV infection through infection control measures both in hospital and in the community, and the use of the RSV-specific monoclonal antibody, palivizumab, for certain high-risk groups of infants. New RSV antivirals and vaccines are currently in development. Ongoing work is needed to improve the prevention of RSV infection, not only because of the acute morbidity and mortality, but also to reduce the associated chronic respiratory morbidity after severe infection.

617,"Prevention of respiratory syncytial virus infection Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection in young children, with significant numbers of premature infants and those with other risk factors requiring hospitalization in Canada each year. Palivizumab, an RSVspecific monoclonal antibody, can reduce the hospitalization rate and severity of illness for a small group of high-risk or premature infants during their first RSV season. The present statement reviews the published literature and provides recommendations regarding its use in premature and other at-risk infants, for Canadian physicians. (Samson L.)"
618,"Respiratory Syncytial Virus Bronchiolitis in Children Respiratory syncytial virus is a highly infectious virus that commonly causes bronchiolitis and leads to high morbidity and a low, but important, incidence of mortality. Supportive therapy is the foundation of management. Hydration/nutrition and respiratory support are important evidence-based interventions. For children with severe disease, continuous positive airway pressure or mechanical ventilation may be necessary. Ribavirin may be used for treatment of patients with severe disease. Palivizumab provides important ongoing immunoprophylaxis during epidemic months for high-risk infants. Caregiver education and incorporating an explanation of all therapies and anticipatory guidance, including strategies for reducing the risk of infection, are vital.  2012 Elsevier Inc..

Studies done in Europe states infected children develop less severe disease with a low case fatality rate, no such review is available from Asia. Methods: Adhering to the PRISMA (Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses) guidelines a systemic review of the literature was performed looking for clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in the Asian pediatric population searching (PUBMED, SCOPUS, MEDLINE, and WHO -19 databases) from 01 January 2020 to 15 September 2020 to find any relevant article with medical subject headings (MeSH) terms like COVID-19, clinical characteristics, children, Asia, demography, outcome, management were used in different combinations. Results: We identified 26 case series across Asian countries consisting of 1664 pediatric patients. Asymptomatic children were 14.9 %. Fever 45.65 % and cough 32.62% were the most common symptoms. Contact history with confirmed COVID-19 positive children was 70.21%. Respiratory coinfection and other co morbidities were present in was present at 36.49 % and 14.09 % children respectively. Abnormal x-ray was observed in 52.1% children and ground-glass opacity were seen among 43.71% of abnormal CT scans. Abnormal laboratory data noted were leucocyte and lymphocytes count, C-reactive protein (CRP), Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and Procalcitonin. One death from COVID-19 was reported from our review. Conclusion: Children mostly acquired infection from adults, the course of the disease is usually milder, they have a good prognosis even with associated respiratory infections and co morbidities, and mortality rate is almost nil from Asia due to COVID -19 in our review.

620,"Burden of severe respiratory syncytial virus disease among 33-35 weeks' gestational age infants born during multiple respiratory syncytial virus seasons Background: Moderate-late preterm infants, 33-35 weeks' gestational age (wGA), are at increased risk for respiratory syncytial virus hospitalization (RSVH). The objective of this study is to quantify the burden of RSVH in moderate-late preterm infants. Methods: A pooled analysis was conducted on RSVH from 7 prospective, observational studies in the Northern Hemisphere from 2000 to 2014. Infants' 33(0)-35(6) wGA without comorbidity born during the respiratory syncytial virus season who did not receive respiratory syncytial virus immunoprophylaxis were enrolled. Data for the first confirmed RSVH during the season (+1 month) were analyzed. Incidence and hospitalization rate per 100 patient-seasons, intensive care unit admission and length of stay (LOS), oxygen support, mechanical ventilation and overall hospital LOS were assessed. Results: The pooled analysis comprised 7,820 infants; 267 experienced a confirmed RSVH at a median age of 8.4 weeks. The crude pooled RSVH incidence rate was 3.41% and the rate per 100 patient-seasons was 4.52. Median hospital LOS was 5.7 days. A total of 22.2% of infants required intensive care unit admission for a median LOS of 8.3 days. A total of 70.4% received supplemental oxygen support for a median of 4.9 days, and 12.7% required mechanical ventilation for a median of 4.8 days. Conclusions: The burden of RSVH in moderate-late, 33-35 weeks' wGA preterm infants without comorbidities born during the viral season in Northern Hemisphere countries is substantial. Severe cases required prolonged and invasive supportive therapy.

621,"Use of mathematical modelling to assess respiratory syncytial virus epidemiology and interventions: a literature review Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of acute lower respiratory tract infection worldwide, resulting in approximately sixty thousand annual hospitalizations of< 5-year-olds in the United States alone and three million annual hospitalizations globally. The development of over 40 vaccines and immunoprophylactic interventions targeting RSV has the potential to significantly reduce the disease burden from RSV infection in the near future. In the context of RSV, a highly contagious pathogen, dynamic transmission models (DTMs) are valuable tools in the evaluation and comparison of the effectiveness of different interventions. This review, the first of its kind for RSV DTMs, provides a valuable foundation for future modelling efforts and highlights important gaps in our understanding of RSV epidemics. Specifically, we have searched the literature using Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, and PubMed to identify all published manuscripts reporting the development of DTMs focused on the population transmission of RSV. We reviewed the resulting studies and summarized the structure, parameterization, and results of the models developed therein. We anticipate that future RSV DTMs, combined with cost-effectiveness evaluations, will play a significant role in shaping decision making in the development and implementation of intervention programs.

622,"Characteristics and Outcomes of Patients in the ICU With Respiratory Syncytial Virus Compared With Those With Influenza Infection: A Multicenter Matched Cohort Study Background: The characteristics and outcomes of adult patients with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection who require ICU admission are poorly defined. Although several studies in adults with RSV infection have been published in recent years, they did not focus specifically on patients with critical illness. Research Question: What are the characteristics and outcomes of adult patients in the ICU with RSV infection and how do they compare with those of patients in the ICU with influenza infection? Study Design and Methods: This retrospective, multicenter study in France and Belgium (17 sites) compared the characteristics and outcomes of adult patients in the ICU with RSV infection vs those with influenza infection between November 2011 and April 2018. Each patient with RSV infection was matched by institution and date of diagnosis with a patient with influenza infection. In-hospital mortality was compared between the two groups, with adjustment for prognostic factors in a multivariate model (sex, age, main underlying conditions, and concurrent bloodstream infection). Results: Data from 618 patients (309 with RSV infection and 309 with influenza infection) were analyzed. Patients with RSV infection were significantly more likely to have an underlying chronic respiratory condition (60.2% vs 40.1%; P < .001) and to be immunocompromised (35% vs 26.2%; P = .02) than patients with influenza infection. Several differences in clinical signs and biological data at diagnosis were found between the groups. In-hospital mortality was not significantly different between the two groups (23.9% in the RSV group vs 25.6% in the influenza group; P = .63), even after adjustment for prognostic factors in a multivariate model. Interpretation: Adult patients in the ICU with RSV infection differ from adult patients in the ICU with influenza in terms of comorbidities and characteristics at diagnosis. RSV infection was associated with high in-hospital mortality, approaching 25%. In multivariate analysis, RSV infection was associated with a similar odds of in-hospital death compared with influenza infection.

623,"Sharing features of uncommon respiratory syncytial virus complications in infants We describe 4 nonconsecutive cases of infants admitted to Catholic University pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) because of complicated respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection during winter RSV outbreaks from the year 2000 to the year 2003. A hyponatremic epileptic status (as in the first case) has been reported by several authors as a rare RSV complication, potentially leading to death. The second infant developed a serious pulmonary edema after a subglottic obstruction (croup) associated with RSV infection. The remaining 2 infants developed a pneumothorax and subcutaneous emphysema while breathing spontaneously during an RSV bronchiolitis. In all infants, a full recovery and PICU discharge was achieved despite the need for mechanical ventilation in cases 1 and 2. Increased intrapleural negative pressure or its combination with hypoxia/hypercapnia has been suggested as the common factor possibly joining these different clinical pictures.

624,"Impact of the 2014 American Academy of Pediatrics Immunoprophylaxis Policy on the Rate, Severity, and Cost of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Hospitalizations among Preterm Infants Objective This study examined the rate, severity, and cost of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) hospitalizations among preterm infants 29 to 34 weeks gestational age (wGA) versus term infants before and after a 2014 change in the American Academy of Pediatrics policy for RSV immunoprophylaxis. Study Design Preterm (29-34 wGA) and term infants born from July 2011 to March 2017 and aged < 6 months were identified in a U.S. commercial administrative claims database. RSV hospitalization (RSVH) rate ratios, severity, and costs were evaluated for the 2011 to 2014 and 2014 to 2017 RSV seasons. Postpolicy changes in RSVH risks for preterm versus term infants were assessed with difference-in-difference (DID) modeling to control for patient characteristics and temporal trends. Results In the DID analysis, prematurity-associated RSVH risk was 55% greater in 2014 to 2017 versus 2011 to 2014 (relative risk = 1.55, 95% confidence interval: 1.10-2.17, p = 0.011). RSVH severity increased among preterm infants after 2014 and was highest among those aged < 3 months. Differences in mean RSVH costs for preterm infants in 2014 to 2017 versus 2011 to 2014 were not statistically significant. Conclusion RSVH risk for preterm versus term infants increased after the policy change, confirming previous national analyses. RSVHs after the policy change were more severe, particularly among younger preterm infants.

625,"Respiratory syncytial virus risk factors in late preterm infants The key role of respiratory syncytial virus RSV in causing infant morbidity and hospitalizations is worldwide well recognized. The late preterm infants 3436 weeks of gestational age WGA showed a higher risk of hospitalization for RSV-induced infection as compared with full-term infants and similar to that seen in very preterm infants. In addition to the prematurity, a number of risk factors have been identified in 3335 WGA infants that are associated with RSV-hospitalization as demonstrated by the Canadian and the Spanish studies. However, prematurity per se is not the only factor, since RSV-hospitalization in the first year of life also occurs in numerous full-term and previously healthy infants. Indeed, a recent casecontrol study on mostly full-term children showed that chronological age at the beginning of RSV season, low birth weight, and birth order 1 sibling were associated with a higher likelihood to acquire RSV-induced LRTI, severe enough to lead to hospital admission. In order to maximize the cost effectiveness of immunoprophylaxis with palivizumab, the American Academy of Pediatrics have recently updated recommendations resulting in a restriction of its use to infants at highest risk of hospitalization during times when RSV is most likely to be circulating i.e. in the first 3 months of life for late preterm infants. According to a variety of epidemiologic data in this gestational age group, the risk of exposure should include day-care attendance and having a sibling <5 years of age. However, in an Italian study, in addition to chronological age at the beginning of RSV season, birth weight and birth order were significant predictors for RSV infection with hospitalization. On the basis of the finding that among nations the difference for severe RSV may exist in environmental and demographic risk factors, an 'International' tool has been developed based on the data from the Spanish FLIP study to predict the likelihood of RSV-hospitalization in newborns 3335 WGA.  2009 Informa UK Ltd.

626,"A prospective randomized controlled blinded study of three bronchodilators in infants with respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis on mechanical ventilation Objective: To study patients with respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis in respiratory failure to make specific measurements reflecting airway resistance before and after treatment with commonly used agents. We hypothesized that racemic epinephrine would decrease airways resistance more effectively than levalbuterol, and levalbuterol would decrease airways resistance more effectively than racemic albuterol. Normal saline was used as a control. DESIGN:: Prospective, randomized, controlled, blinded study. SETTING:: Tertiary Pediatric Intensive Care Unit in a University affiliated hospital in the northeastern United States. PATIENTS:: Twenty-two patients with respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis and in respiratory failure were enrolled. All were intubated and ventilated in a volume control mode and sedated. INTERVENTIONS:: In a randomized, blinded fashion patients were given four agents: norepinephrine, levalbuterol, racemic albuterol, and normal saline at 6 hr intervals. MEASUREMENTS:: As indicators of bronchodilation, peak inspiratory pressure and inspiratory respiratory system resistance were measured before and 20 mins after each agent was given. Thus, each patient acted as his/her own control. MAIN RESULTS:: There were small but statistically significant decreases in peak inspiratory pressure after racemic epinephrine treatment, levalbuterol, and racemic albuterol. There was no change in peak inspiratory pressure after inhaled normal saline. Inspiratory respiratory system resistance fell significantly after all treatments, including saline. Heart rate rose significantly after inhaled bronchodilator treatments (p < 0.05 for all treatments). CONCLUSIONS:: Similar statistically significant bronchodilation occurred after all three bronchodilators as indicated by a decrease in peak inspiratory pressure and respiratory system resistance, but these changes were small and probably clinically insignificant. However, side effects of bronchodilators, such as tachycardia, also occurred, and these may be clinically significant. Thus the benefit of bronchodilator treatment in these patients is small, does not differ among the drugs we studied and of questionable value.  2008 by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies.

627,"Cell-mediated immune responses to respiratory syncytial virus infection: Magnitude, kinetics, and correlates with morbidity and age We evaluated the cell-mediated immune (CMI) response to RSV acute infection including the magnitude, kinetics and correlates with morbidity and age. Twenty-nine RSV-infected patients with mean  SD age of 15  14 months were enrolled during their first week of disease. Th1, Th2, Th9, Th17 and Th22 responses were measured at entry and 2 and 6 weeks later. All subjects were hospitalized for a median (range) of 5 (3-11) days. RSV-specific effector and memory Th1 CMI measured by lymphocyte proliferation and IFN ELISPOT significantly increased over time (P  0.03). In contrast, Th22 responses decreased over time (P  0.03). Other changes did not reach statistical significance. The severity of RSV disease measured by the length of hospitalization positively correlated with the magnitude of Th9, Th22 and TNF inflammatory responses (rho  0.4; P  0.04) and negatively with memory CMI (rho = -0.45; P = 0.04). The corollary of this observation is that robust Th1 and/or low Th9, Th22, and TNF inflammatory responses may be associated with efficient clearance of RSV infection and therefore desirable characteristics of an RSV vaccine. Young age was associated with low memory and effector Th1 responses (rho  0.4; P  0.04) and high Th2, Th9, Th17, Th22 and TNF inflammatory responses (rho  -0.4; P  0.04), indicating that age at vaccination may be a major determinant of the CMI response pattern.  2014 Landes Bioscience.

628,"The burden of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) associated acute lower respiratory infections in children with Down syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis Background: Acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRIs) caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are a leading cause of hospitalization in infants. Numerous risk factors have been identified in the aetiology of severe RSV-associated ALRI necessitating hospitalisation, including prematurity and congenital heart disease. Down syndrome (DS), a common genetic disorder associated with congenital and dysmorphic features, has recently been identified as an independent risk factor for RSV-associated ALRI requiring hospitalisation; however, the disease burden of RSV-associated ALRI in this population has not yet been established. Similarly, the impact of DS as an independent risk factor has not yet been quantified. We aimed therefore to estimate the incidence of admissions in children with DS, and by comparing this with unaffected children, to quantify the risk of DS independent of other risk factors.Methods: A systematic review of the existing literature published between 1995 and March 1, 2017 was performed to quantify the incidence of hospitalisation due to RSV-associated ALRI in children with DS. Meta-analyses were performed on extracted data using STATA statistical software, and hospitalisation rates for children with and without DS under the age of 2 were calculated.Findings: 5 articles were ultimately deemed eligible for analyses. Analyses were limited to children under the age of 2 years. We calculated the hospitalisation rate for children with DS in this age group to be 117.6 per 1000 child-years (95% CI 67.4-205.2), vs a rate of 15.2 per 1000 child-years (95% CI 8.3-27.6) in unaffected children. This indicates DS contributes to a 6.8 (95% CI 5.5-8.4) fold increase in the relative risk of hospitalisation for RSV-associated ALRI.Interpretation: Though limited by a small number of articles, this review found sufficient evidence to conclude DS was a significant independent risk factor for the development of severe RSV-associated ALRI requiring hospitalisation. Further studies are needed to define the impact of DS in conjunction with other comorbidities on the risk of severe RSV infection. Determining benefits of immunoprophylaxis or future vaccines against RSV in this at-risk population is warranted. (Chan M.; Nair H.)

629,"Pertussis and respiratory syncytial virus infections During the winter 2005-2006, all infants <4 months of age admitted for bronchiolitis or acute respiratory tract infection in a tertiary care pediatric hospital in Paris were tested for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and pertussis with real-time polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR). A positive pertussis-PCR was found in 14/90 (16%) infants infected with RSV and in 5/30 negative for RSV. Similar clinical symptoms were found in all RSV-positive infants with or without pertussis co-infection. Most infants (73%) were not vaccinated against pertussis, and the other children had received one or two injections.

630,"Plasma interferon-, interleukin-10 and soluble markers of immune activation in infants with primary adenovirus (ADV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection Adenovirus (ADV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are etiological agents of acute respiratory tract infection in infants. Long-term prognosis of ADV infection includes severe lung damage, bronchiectasis and hyperlucent lung, while RSV infection is associated with development of recurrent wheezing and subsequent asthma. These differences may be related to differences in the primary immune responses elicited by these viruses. In this paper, we investigated the type of cytokine responses and the magnitude of immune activation in ADV and RSV infections in infants. We examined plasma concentrations of interferon- (IFN-), interleukin-10 (IL-10), soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sCD25) and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor II (sTNFR-II) in previously healthy infants during the acute phase of primary ADV infection (n = 21) and RSV infection (n = 68), and in uninfected controls (n = 44). In ADV-infected infants, IFN- plasma levels were significantly higher than those observed in RSV cases and the control group (p < 0.05). RSV cases did not show any differences in IFN- plasma levels compared to the other groups. sCD25 levels were significantly higher in ADV- and RSV-infected infants than in controls (p < 0.0001), and higher in ADV than in RSV cases (p < 0.05). sTNFR-II levels were significantly higher in RSV- and ADV-infected infants than in controls (p < 0.0001, p < 0.05, respectively), and higher in RSV than in ADV infection (p < 0.05). No significant differences were observed in IL-10 plasma concentrations between the three groups. These results indicate that ADV and RSV infections in infants differ significantly with regard to the magnitude of production of interferon-gamma and soluble immune activation markers sCD25 and sTNFR-II. These immunological differences may be involved in the different clinical outcomes associated with these viral infections. (Fernandez J.A., jfernand@med.uchile.cl; Tapia L.; Larranaga C.; Pena M.)

631,"Respiratory Syncytial Virus Immunoprophylaxis: Impact on Epidemiology Objective: To better understand the spectrum of disease among hospitalised children infected with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and to assess the potential impact of passive immunoprophylaxis on RSV hospitalisation rates, we analysed all patients infected with RSV who were admitted to a paediatric teaching hospital over a 3-year period. Design: We performed a retrospective chart review of all paediatric patients from whom RSV was isolated between October 1, 1994 and April 30, 1997. Results: A total of 255 children infected with RSV were hospitalised during this 3-year period. 246 (96%) patients had community acquired infections and 9 (4%) had nosocomial infections. Excluding patients with nosocomial infections, the mean length of hospital stay was 4.7 days. 70 (28%) children were admitted to the intensive care unit, 32 (13%) were intubated and there was a total of 4 deaths (1.6%). 48% of hospitalised patients were in 1 of 4 previously recognised high risk groups. Of the 52% of patients not in a defined high risk category, 42% were otherwise healthy infants (>6 weeks of age) and 10% had chronic underlying illnesses generally not associated with an increased risk of severe RSV disease. Patients not in a defined high risk category accounted for 46% of total hospital days. Conclusion: In order to reduce overall RSV hospitalisation rates and the economic burden to society, programmes for disease prevention must be directed at healthy infants as well as children in recognised high risk categories. Even if all currently eligible candidates were to have received passive immunoprophylaxis, which yields about a 50% reduction in hospitalisation rates, the number of RSV hospitalisations in our 3-year study would have been reduced by no more than 9%. Without development and widespread use of an effective RSV vaccine, a major impact on RSV-induced hospitalisation is unlikely.

632,"Respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis: An update Bronchiolitis due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the leading causes of hospitalization of infants under 12 months of age in our patient population; the mortality associated with this infection ranges around 0.5%, although in risk groups, the rate can reach up to approximately 3%. For this reason, it is important to clearly define the groups at risk for this infection, as well as to design adequate prevention strategies for these patient subgroups. The importance of understanding this infection lies not only in its early diagnosis and proper therapeutic management, but in the in-depth knowledge of the virus and the immune response of the organism, as well. There is a large body of evidence supporting a causal relationship between RSV infection and post-bronchiolitis asthma, although we still need to clarify key aspects that will enable us to determine which patients will present recurrent wheezing and which patients will not, and whether the virus actually triggers asthma or is simply a marker that selects individuals who are genetically predisposed to develop this disease.

633,"Effect of prematurity on respiratory syncytial virus hospital resource use and outcomes Objectives: To determine if gestational age (GA) is independently associated with hospital resource use and outcomes among infants hospitalized for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Study design: Analysis of retrospective data from 304 infants (1 year) with bronchiolitis or RSV pneumonia admitted to nine children's hospitals from April 1995 to September 1996. Resource use and outcomes examined included admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), intubation, and hospital and ICU length of stay. The Comprehensive Severity Index controlled for severity of illness. Results: Two hundred fifteen term infants (GA 37 weeks) and 89 infants with GA <37 weeks, divided according to GA into 3 subgroups (32, 33 to 35, and 36 weeks), were compared. Significant differences were found for rate of intubation (P = .002) and ICU and hospital length of stay (P = .021 and P < .0001, respectively), with the highest resource use in 33 to 35 weeks GA infants, which remained significant in multiple regression analyses. Conclusions: Infants 33 to 35 weeks GA had hospital outcomes that were negative or worse than infants 32 weeks GA. Data suggest prematurity 35 weeks GA significantly increases the risk for severe outcomes among infants hospitalized for RSV. Infants 36 weeks GA had outcomes similar to term infants. No evidence was observed of gradation or inverse linear risk relation between GA and hospital outcomes. (Horn S.D., shorn@isisicor.com; Smout R.J.)

634,"Respiratory syncytial virus infection in adults Originally considered as only a paediatric pathogen, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has recently been shown to be a significant cause of respiratory illness among elderly and high-risk adults. Approximately 170,000 hospitalizations and 10,000 deaths associated with RSV occur annually in people over the age of 65 years in the United States. Although rhinorrhoea and wheezing are common symptoms among adults, the clinical syndrome associated with RSV is not distinctive and thus laboratory methods are required for specific diagnosis. Presently, the combination of reverse transcription PCR and enzyme immunoassay serology offers the best sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of RSV. Treatment options are limited at present, with inhaled ribavirin being the only licensed drug for use in hospitalized children. Vaccines against RSV remain an unachieved goal. Promising new agents that inhibit the virus-cell fusion, cell-cell fusion, or viral gene expression are currently in development.  2007 International Medical Press.

635,"Respiratory syncytial virus immunoprophylaxis: Impact on epidemiology Objective: To better understand the spectrum of disease among hospitalised children infected with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and to assess the potential impact of passive immunoprophylaxis on RSV hospitalisation rates, we analysed all patients infected with RSV who were admitted to a paediatric teaching hospital over a 3-year period. Design: We performed a retrospective chart review of all paediatric patients from whom RSV was isolated between October 1, 1994 and April 30, 1997. Results: A total of 255 children infected with RSV were hospitalised during this 3-year period. 246 (96%) patients had community acquired infections and 9 (4%) had nosocomial infections. Excluding patients with nosocomial infections, the mean length of hospital stay was 4.7 days. 70 (28%) children were admitted to the intensive care unit, 32 (13%) were intubated and there was a total of 4 deaths (1.6%). 48% of hospitalised patients were in 1 of 4 previously recognised high risk groups. Of the 52% of patients not in a defined high risk category, 42% were otherwise healthy infants (>6 weeks of age) and 10% had chronic underlying illnesses generally not associated with an increased risk of severe RSV disease. Patients not in a defined high risk category accounted for 46% of total hospital days. Conclusion: In order to reduce overall RSV hospitalisation rates and the economic burden to society, programmes for disease prevention must be directed at healthy infants as well as children in recognised high risk categories. Even if all currently eligible candidates were to have received passive immunoprophylaxis, which yields about a 50% reduction in hospitalisation rates, the number of RSV hospitalisations in our 3-year study would have been reduced by no more than 9%.

636,"Incidence, hospitalization, and mortality in children aged 5 years and younger with respiratory syncytial virus-related diseases: A systematic review and meta-analysis Objectives: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection in young children. We aimed to analyze the factors affecting the estimation of RSV-related disease burden, and to provide evidence to help establish a surveillance system. Methods: We searched the English- and Chinese-language databases for articles published between January 1, 2010 and June 2, 2022. The quality of the included articles was assessed using the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality scale. Random-effects models were used for data synthesis and subgroup analyses. This review was registered in the Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO: CRD42022372972). Results: We included 44 studies (149,321,171 participants), all of which were of medium or high quality. The pooled RSV-related disease incidence, hospitalization rate, in-hospital mortality, and overall mortality rates in children aged 5 years and younger were 9.0 per 100 children per year (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.011.0), 1.7 per 100 children per year (95% CI: 1.32.1), 0.5 per 100 children per year (95% CI: 0.40.5), and 0.05 per 100 children per year (95% CI: 0.040.06), respectively. Age, economics, surveillance types, case definition, and data source were all recognized as influencing factors. Conclusions: A standardized and unified RSV surveillance system is required. Case definition and surveillance types should be fully considered for surveillance of different age groups.

637,"Recurrence of wheezing episodes in children with respiratory syncytial virus and non-respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis Objective: It has been shown that many children who experience respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in infancy develop recurrent wheezing episodes and asthma later. Viral role in pathogenesis of asthma is still a debate. We aimed to investigate the recurrence of wheezing episodes, atopy and serum cytokine levels in children encountered with RSV infection. Additionally, we aimed to compare these parameters in children with non-RSV bronchiolitis. Material and Methods: The study was conducted between January 2006 and November 2008 in Dokuz Eylul University hospital. Seventy children aged between 0-36 months who were diagnosed with acute bronchiolitis for the first time were recruited for the study. Nasopharyngeal lavage fluid was analyzed with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for RSV antigen in all patients. Serum immunoglobulin E, total eosinophil count, interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13 and y-inter- feron (IFN-) levels were obtained at the last examination of the patients after a follow up period of 1-3 years. Results: Recurrence of a wheezing episode was observed in 35% and 53.3% of the patients in RSV group and non-RSV group, respectively (p= 0.064). Mean serum IFN-y and IL-4 levels were detected to be significantly higher in non-RSV group. No significant relation was detected between recurrence of wheezing episodes and total eosinophil count, serum IgE, IL-4, IL-13, and IFN-y levels. Conclusion: No difference could be detected between RSV and non- RSV bronchiolitis regarding subsequent wheezing episodes. Although serum IL-4 and IFN- levels were higher in non-RSV bronchiolitis group, no significant correlation was observed between these parameters and recurrence of wheezing episodes.  2011 by Turkiye Klinikleri.

638,"Prognosis of hospitalised adult patients with respiratory syncytial virus infection: a multicentre retrospective cohort study Objectives: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common agent of viral respiratory infections with significant morbidity and mortality in adults. The objective of this study was to determine risk factors for mortality and invasive mechanical ventilation and to describe the characteristics of patients who received ribavirin. Methods: A retrospective multicentre observational cohort study was conducted in Great Paris area hospitals, including patients hospitalised between 1 January 2015 and 31 December 2019 for documented RSV infection. Data were extracted from the Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris Health Data Warehouse. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality. Results: One thousand one hundred sixty-eight patients were hospitalised for RSV infection, including 288 (24.6%) patients who required intensive care unit (ICU) admission. The median (interquartile range) age of patients was 75 (6385) years, and 54% (n = 631/1168) of them were women. In-hospital mortality was 6.6% (n = 77/1168) in the whole cohort and 12.8% (n = 37/288) in ICU patients. Factors associated with hospital mortality were age >85 years (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 6.29, 95% confidence interval [2.4715.98]), acute respiratory failure (aOR = 2.83 [1.196.72]), non-invasive (aOR = 12.60 [1.41112.36]), and invasive mechanical ventilation support (aOR = 30.13 [3.17286.27]) and neutropenia (aOR = 13.19 [3.2753.27]). Factors associated with invasive mechanical ventilation were chronic heart (aOR = 1.98 [1.203.26]) or respiratory failure (aOR = 2.83 [1.674.80]), and co-infection (aOR = 2.62 [1.604.30]). Patients who were treated with ribavirin were significantly younger than others (62 [5569] vs. 75 [6386] years; p < 0.001), more frequently males (n = 34/48 [70.8%] vs. n = 503/1120 [44.9%]; p 0.001), and almost exclusively immunocompromised (n = 46/48 [95.8%] vs. n = 299/1120 [26.7%]; p < 0.001). Discussion: The mortality rate of patients hospitalised with RSV infections was 6.6%. Twenty-five per cent of the patients required ICU admission.

639,"The frequency, clinical and laboratory features of RSV in small children with bronchiolitis Aim: The aim of this study was to determine the frequency and of RSV clinical and laboratory features of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in small children with bronchiolitis in 2008-2009. Material and Method: A total of 79 children younger than two years of age with bronchiolitis at whom RSV antigen was analyzed in the nasopharengeal secretion between October 2008-May 2009 were evaluated from clinical charts retrospectively. Results: Respiratory syncytial virus antigen in nasopharengeal secretions was positive in 16 (%20) of 79 patients. The age, sex, mean gestational week, duration of breast feeding, fever, mean leukocyte count, C-reactive protein (CRP) level and hospitalization rate were not significantly different between the RSV positive and negative patients. Respiratory syncytial virus infection was frequently detected in December. Intensive care unit admission for advanced respiratory support was found significantly higher in the RSV positive patients. Conclusions: Respiratory syncytial virus incidence in children younger than two years-old with the diagnosis of bronchiolitis was %20, concordant with the literature. Although hospitalization rate of RSV positive and negatif patients is similar, intensive care unit admission for advanced respiratory support was significantly higher in RSV positive patients. Therefore, as RSV infection in infants and high risk patients has a severe clinical course, this situation increases the importance of early diagnosis and prophylaxis.

In this study, the data on all patients less than 14 years of age hospitalized with respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis over the past 4 years was reviewed. Patients who had concomitant diagnoses consistent with neurologic disease underwent detailed chart review. There were 964 patients (age 0.1 to 13.6 years) with a diagnosis of respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis. Thirty-six of these patients had concurrent neurologic diagnoses. Twenty-four patients were excluded because of preexistent neurologic disorders, probable simple febrile seizures, or a history of epilepsy. Twelve respiratory syncytial virus-positive patients had definite neurologic complications without another recognized cause. Seven of these patients had seizures (predominantly generalized tonic-clonic and one with status epilepticus), three had generalized encephalopathy (marked hypotonia and decreased responsiveness) of whom two also developed esotropia. Two patients developed isolated esotropia. There was an incidence of neurologic complications of 1.2% (0.7% seizures) in a total of 964 patients with respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis. This percentage does not include presumed simple febrile seizures or exacerbations of preexisting seizure disorder (further 1.3%).

641,"Human respiratory syncytial virus and influenza seasonality patternsEarly findings from the WHO global respiratory syncytial virus surveillance Background: Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes illnesses among all age groups and presents a burden to healthcare services. To better understand the epidemiology and seasonality of RSV in different geographical areas, the World Health Organization (WHO) coordinated a pilot initiative to access the feasibility of establishing RSV surveillance using the existing Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) platform. Objectives: To describe and compare RSV and influenza seasonality in countries in the northern andsouthern temperate, and tropics during the period January 2017 to April 2019. Methods: Fourteen countries in six WHO regions participating in the GISRS were invited for the pilot. Hospitalized patients presenting with severe acute respiratory illness (SARI), SARI without fever and outpatients presenting with acute respiratory illness (ARI) were enrolled from January 2017 to April 2019. The expected minimum sample size was 20 samples per week, year-round, per country. Real-time RT-PCR was used to detect RSV and influenza viruses. Results were uploaded to the WHO FluMart platform. Results: Annual seasonality of RSV was observed in all countries, which overlapped to a large extent with the influenza activity. In countries, in temperate regions RSV peaked in the autumn/winter months. In Egypt, a subtropical country, RSV activity peaked in the cooler season. In the tropical regions, RSV peaked during the rainy seasons. Conclusion: Early findings from the WHO RSV surveillance pilot based on the GISRS suggest annual seasonal patterns for of RSV circulation that overlap with influenza. RSV surveillance needs to be continued for several more seasons to establish seasonality patterns to inform prevention and control strategies. (Chadha M.)

642,"Predictors and incidence of hospitalization due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-associated lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in non-prophylaxed moderate-to-late preterm infants in Bosnia and Herzegovina Prematurity is a risk factor for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-associated lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs), due to immature humoral and cell-mediated immune system in preterm newborns, as well as their incomplete lung development. Palivizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against the F glycoprotein of RSV, is licensed for the prevention of severe RSV LRTI in children at high risk for the disease. This study is a part of a larger observational, retrospective-prospective epidemiological study (PONI) conducted at 72 sites across 23 countries in the northern temperate zone. The aim of our non-interventional study was to identify common predictors and factors associated with RSV LRTI hospitalization in non-prophylaxed, moderate-to-late preterm infants, born between 33 weeks and 0 days and 35 weeks and 6 days of gestation, and less than 6 months prior to or during the RSV season in Bosnia and Herzegovina (B&H). A total of 160 moderate-to-late preterm infants were included from four sites in B&H (Sarajevo, Tuzla, Mostar, and Banja Luka). We identified several significant intrinsic and extrinsic factors to be associated with the risk of RSV LRTI hospitalization in the preterm infants, including: comorbidities after birth, shorter hospital stay, admission to NICU/PICU while in the maternity ward, household smoking, low maternal age, breast feeding, number of family members, and history of family/paternal atopy. Overall, our results indicated that the risk of RSV LRTI in preterm newborns can be associated with different environmental and social/cultural factors, and further research is needed to comprehensively evaluate these associations.

643,"Respiratory syncytial virus infection in adults Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) belongs to the recently defined Pneumoviridae family, Orthopneumovirus genus. It is a negative sense, single stranded RNA virus that results in epidemics of respiratory infections that typically peak in the winter in temperate climates and during the rainy season in tropical climates. Generally, one of the two genotypes (A and B) predominates in a single season, alternating annually, although regional variation occurs. RSV is a cause of disease and death in children, older people, and immunocompromised patients, and its clinical effect on adults admitted to hospital is clarified with expanded use of multiplex molecular assays. Among adults, RSV produces a wide range of clinical symptoms including upper respiratory tract infections, severe lower respiratory tract infections, and exacerbations of underlying disease. Here we discuss the latest evidence on the burden of RSV related disease in adults, especially in those with immunocompromise or other comorbidities. We review current therapeutic and prevention options, as well as those in development.

644,"Current State of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Disease and Management Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of hospitalizations due to pneumonia and bronchiolitis. Substantial morbidity and socioeconomic burden are associated with RSV infection worldwide. Populations with higher susceptibility to developing severe RSV include premature infants, children with chronic lung disease of prematurity (CLDP) or congenital heart disease (CHD), elderly individuals aged > 65 years, and immunocompromised individuals. In the pediatric population, RSV can lead to long-term sequelae such as wheezing and asthma, which are associated with increased health care costs and reduced quality of life. Treatment for RSV is mainly supportive, and general preventive measures such as good hygiene and isolation are highly recommended. Although vaccine development for RSV has been a global priority, attempts to date have failed to yield a safe and effective product for clinical use. Currently, palivizumab is the only immunoprophylaxis (IP) available to prevent severe RSV in specific high-risk pediatric populations. Well-controlled, randomized clinical trials have established the efficacy of palivizumab in reducing RSV hospitalization (RSVH) in high-risk infants including moderate- to late-preterm infants. However, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), in its 2014 policy, stopped recommending RSV IP use for  29 weeks gestational age infants. Revisions to the AAP policy for RSV IP have largely narrowed the proportion of pediatric patients eligible to receive RSV IP and have been associated with an increase in RSVH and morbidity. On the other hand, after reviewing the recent evidence on RSV burden, the National Perinatal Association, in its 2018 clinical practice guidelines, recommended RSV IP use for a wider pediatric population. As the AAP recommendations drive insurance reimbursements for RSV IP, they should be revised to help further mitigate RSV disease burden. (Chatterjee A.)

Methods: An online survey was conducted across the Australian and New Zealand Neonatal Network (ANZNN) to determine clinical practices around palivizumab. A literature search was also performed to identify and compare national and international guidelines. Results: A total of 65 of 422 ANZNN members completed the survey. Respondents included 61 senior medical staff of consultants/staff specialists (78%) and four nursing staff (6%). According to the survey, infants most likely to be recommended palivizumab included preterm infants born <29 weeks gestational age (GA) (30%), children with chronic lung diseases (CLDs) born <32 weeks GA (40%), and with hemodynamically significant heart disease (35%). Many of the respondents (53%) stated that CPGs for palivizumab were developed locally. Literature search identified 20 guidelines (10 international and 10 domestic); 16 (80%) recommended palivizumab use in preterm infants, 16 (80%) recommended use in infants with CLD, 17 (85%) in congenital heart disease and 6 (30%) in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Eight (40%) guidelines provided specific recommendations for immunocompromised infants. Canada, Western Australia, and American Academy of Paediatrics provided recommendations for Indigenous children. Frequency and dosage of palivizumab was universal across all CPGs. None of the international guidelines obtained were from low- or middle-income countries. Conclusions: Standardization of CPGs may improve clinical decision making around use of palivizumab in high-risk infants. (Stiboy E.)

Results: The annual published output of RSV-related research has increased by 29% over the period 2011-2015. Eighty seven percent (13/15) of the most highly cited papers on RSV during this period were from North America. US universities with the highest number of RSV-related publications included Emory (n = 23), Vanderbilt (n = 23), University of Michigan (n = 21) and Ohio State (n = 20). The UK (n = 125), Netherlands (n = 97) and Spain (n = 76) were major European contributors to RSV-related publications. University Medical Centre Utrecht (n = 40) and Imperial College London (n = 28) were the European universities with the largest number of RSV-related publications. The National Institutes of Health provided funding for one quarter of all RSV-related publications. However, few countries in Eastern Europe, Central America and the Caribbean published RSV-related research. Few epidemiological studies focused on adult populations over 18 years old (n = 28, 7%) with only five publications specifically investigating elderly populations over 65. Conclusions: This review identifies key regions and research institutions which contributed to RSV-related research during 2011-2015 as well as the donor agencies which supported this research. Further research investment is required in a number of countries. More research in the elderly and in high-risk adults is required given the lack of studies pertaining to these populations. Researchers and those commissioning research can use the data from this review to identify productive research institutions and geographical gaps in RSV research.

647,"Respiratory Syncytial Virus Pediatric Hospitalization in the COVID-19 Era Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) globally affects the population, mainly young children, potentially causing hospitalization. During the COVID-19 pandemic, non-pharmacological measures interfered with the circulation of most respiratory viruses. Then, with the discontinuation of restrictive measures, a new scenario appeared. With this scoping review, we want to globally explore whether the RSV paediatric hospitalization rate was influenced by COVID-19. This scoping review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines on PubMed using the Mesh terms Respiratory Syncytial Viruses[Mesh] AND COVID-19[Mesh] OR SARS-CoV-2[Mesh]. Among them, we identified studies pertaining to children and adolescents up to 18 years old hospitalized for RSV, including 18 records in the revision. With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, a drastic reduction in RSV hospitalization among the pediatric population in 20202021 season has been observed in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. After the relaxing of restrictive measures, unexpected outbreaks happened, leading to increased hospitalization and occupation of pediatric intensive care units.

648,"Incidence of respiratory syncytial virus-positive hospitalizations in Germany Epidemiological data, especially population-based data, on respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-related hospitalizations in Germany have been lacking to date. Since Palivizumab (Synagis, Abbott, USA) is already available and new vaccines for active immunization are under development, these data are urgently needed. From July 1996 to June 1999, nasopharyngeal aspirates of children hospitalized in Kiel with an acute respiratory tract infection were tested by multiplex reverse transcrip-tase polymerase chain reaction. Of 1,241 patients, 150 (12.1%) were RSV positive. RSV was the predominant pathogen detected through the end of the second year. In 37 (25%) children an underlying condition was present. For the city of Kiel and close surroundings, the cumulative incidence of RSV-positive hospitalizations in infants was 1,214/10(5) (725/10(5) in children less than 2 years). For those children less than 2 years old born with a gestational age of less than 32 weeks or 32-37 weeks, the cumulative incidence was 2,025/10(5) and 1,202/10(5), respectively (dose-effect response). For the group less than 32 weeks of age, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) as an underlying condition carried a relative risk of 17.8. The RSV season began between the end of September and January and ended between March and July. The population-based incidence of RSV-positive hospitalizations in Kiel is close to that reported from the UK and Scandinavia. Throughout Germany, approximately 10,000 RSV-related hospitalizations in infants can be expected annually. Prematurity is an effect modifier and BPD a strong risk factor for RSV-positive hospitalization in population-based studies. There is considerable variation in the start and end of the yearly epidemic. (Weigl J.A.I., weigl@pediatrics.uni-kiel.de; Puppe W.; Schmitt H.J.)

649,"Impact of aerosolized ribavirin on mortality in 280 allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients with respiratory syncytial virus infections Objectives: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections are well recognized as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT) recipients. We evaluated the spectrum of clinical manifestations, management (including ribavirin-based antiviral therapy) and outcomes of RSV infections and determined the risk factors associated with RSV lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) and all-cause mortality. Methods: In this retrospective study, we analysed clinical data from all laboratory-confirmed RSV infections in allo-HSCT recipients (n1/4280) who presented at our institution from January 1996 to May 2009. Results: Of the 280 patients, 80 (29%) developed LRTI within 20 days (median 1 day, range 0-19 days) and 44 (16%) died within 90 days (median 26 days, range 1-82 days) from RSV diagnosis. Multivariable logistic regression analyses identified several significant risk factors associated with RSV LRTI and all-cause mortality, including age, male sex, neutropenia, lymphocytopenia and lack of ribavirin-based antiviral therapy at the upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) stage. Aerosolized ribavirin-based therapy at the URTI stage was the single most significant factor in reducing the risk of RSV LRTI (83%), all-cause mortality (57%) and RSV-associated mortality (87%) in these patients (P<0.05), irrespective of the year of RSV diagnosis. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that RSV infections are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in high-risk allo-HSCT recipients and ribavirin-based antiviral therapy at the URTI stage had a positive impact on both outcomes in this vulnerable population with multiple risk factors.

650,"Respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis in ex-preterm infants in the Scottish Highlands: Review of hospitals admissions and an analysis of hospital cost Ex-preterm infants are vulnerable to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis and their hospital admission is associated with increased morbidity. Palivizumab is currently available as prophylaxis against RSV infection but its use in ex-preterm infants is controversial. A retrospective case review study was, therefore, carried out to determine the rate of readmission with RSV bronchiolitis among ex-preterm infants in the Highland Region of Scotland and to estimate the hospital cost per admission. Between 1995 and 1999, a total of 3,046 children under 2 years of age were admitted to Raigmore Hospital, 1,691 of whom (60.4%) lived outwith Inverness. 507 children had acute bronchiolitis and ex preterm infants with RSV positive bronchiolitis accounted for 3.6% of total admissions with acute bronchiolitis. 72% of these children lived outwith Inverness. The median length of hospital stay for children born at less than 30 weeks and for children who had had bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) was 6 and 10.5 days respectively. The average hospital costs per admission for children of less than 30 weeks and children of more than 30 weeks were 3,376 and 2,074 respectively. It was more expensive for children with BPD (4,431 per admission) when compared with those without BPD (1,959 per admission). This study has shown that most of the children admitted to hospital lived outwith Inverness, many at some considerable distance, and this, as much as severity of illness, may have contributed to hospital admission. Further studies are required to determine productivity losses associated with RSV infection and justification of use of Palivizumab in ex preterm infants of less than 30 weeks gestation and of BPD living in remote areas of Scottish Highlands.

651,"Respiratory syncytial virus infections in children Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of lower respiratory disease in young children in both developing and developed countries. By age 2, nearly all children have been infected by RSV. The clinical manifestations range from mild upper respiratory symptoms to bronchiolitis and pneumonia. First infections are nearly always symptomatic and frequently cause lower respiratory tract disease, whereas subsequent infections are generally milder. Although children with underlying conditions such as prematurity, chronic lung disease, congenital heart disease, and immunosuppression are at high risk for severe disease, many children without underlying conditions require hospitalization. Treatment is supportive. Immunoprophylaxis with palivizumab or RSV immune globulin may benefit children born prematurely, especially those with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. To date, the development of an effective vaccine has been unsuccessful. Copyright 2002, Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

652,"Bacteremia in Children Hospitalized Due to Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection The frequency of bacteremia in children hospitalized due to respiratory syncytial virus infection (RSV) rarely exceeds 1%, but a recent study reported a 10% risk of bacteremia. In this study, we set out to verify the frequency, usefulness, and costs of blood cultures in RSV infections. We addressed the issue by reviewing medical files of 512 children, aged 8 days121 months, who were hospitalized during January 2010 and June 2017. The RSV-related diagnoses included bronchiolitis (390 patients), RSV pneumonia (65 patients), and bronchitis (57 patients). There were 212 blood cultures performed in 185 patients (36%). In 10 cultures (5.4%), the following pathogens were identified: Staphylococcus haemolyticus, 4; Staphylococcus epidermidis, 1; Staphylococcus hominis, 1; Corynebacterium, 1 Streptococcus parasanguinis, 1; Rothia mucilaginosa, 1; Micrococcus luteus, 1; and Streptococcus hominis, 1 case. However, all of these pathogens were identified as a contamination of samples only. Therefore, both positive blood cultures turned out in fact negative, and the patients having either result of blood culturing showed no clinically relevant differences. The total cost of blood cultures in the pediatric ward amounted to 1980. If performed in each and every patient, the costs would have reached 5490. In conclusion, the frank frequency of bacteremia in children with RSV infection, with no sepsis, seems exceedingly low, which confirms the earlier findings. Thus, blood culturing, generating high costs, is of negligible clinical value. The study provides no evidence supporting a routine blood culture in case of children hospitalized due to RSV infection.

653,"Etiology of viral pneumopathies in patients in intensive care unit under mechanical ventilation. The objective of this work was to define the etiology of viral pneumopathies at the patients from reanimation section being under mechanical ventilation, making reference to viruses with respiratory tropism, and also to Chlamydia Pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. The subjects were 36 patients hospitalized into Service of Medical Reanimation from CHU Caen and who needed mechanical ventilation more than 48 hours. The samples from the patients were mostly nasal aspirate, 1 bronchial aspirate and 2 tracheal aspirates. The diagnosis tests were: the test of direct immunofluorescence (DIF) from the samples (for Influenza viruses A and B, Parainfluenza 1,2,3, Adenovirus and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), inoculation on the tissue culture of diploid cells MRC5, and at the appearance of cythopatic effect specific for Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV), it was made DIF for the detection of type 1 or 2, and also there were made 6 techniques of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). The results of the tests were: at admission before installing the mechanical ventilation, 6 patients presented an infection with Rhinoviruses (RV), 3 with Influenza type A, 3 with HSV type 1 and 2 with Enterovirus. After a period of time from installing the mechanical ventilation, 8 patients presented an infection with HSV typel, among who 1 presented at admission an infection with RV, and 1 patient presented at 7 days from installing the mechanical ventilation an infection with RSV, and at 16 days an infection with HSV type 1. Thus, it could be concluded that in 25% from the cases of viral pneumopathies from patients being under mechanical ventilation it was an endogen reactivation of HSV type1 and only into a single case was diagnosed initially with an infection with RSV, after that it appeared also an infection with HSV typel.

654,"Respiratory syncytial virus infection in children Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an RNA virus that causes respiratory tract infections in children. In the Northern Hemisphere, the peak infection season is November through April. By two years of age, most children will have had an RSV infection. Bronchiolitis, a lower respiratory tract infection, is often caused by RSV. An RSV infection is diagnosed based on patient history and physical examination. Children typically present with cough, coryza, and wheezing. Laboratory testing and chest radiography are not necessary to make the diagnosis. Serious concurrent bacterial infections are rare. Treatment of an RSV infection is supportive, with particular attention to maintaining hydration and oxygenation. Children younger than 60 days and those with severe symptoms may require hospitalization. Neither antibiotics nor corticosteroids are helpful for bronchiolitis. A bronchodilator trial is appropriate for children with wheezing, but should not be continued unless there is a prompt favorable response. Frequent hand washing and contact isolation may prevent the spread of RSV infections. Children younger than two years at high risk of severe illness, including those born before 35 weeks of gestation and those with chronic lung or cardiac problems, may be candidates for palivizumab prophylaxis for RSV infection during the peak infection season.

655,"A phase 2, randomized, double-blind safety and pharmacokinetic assessment of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) prophylaxis with motavizumab and palivizumab administered in the same season Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an important pathogen causing annual epidemics of bronchiolitis and pneumonia among infants worldwide. High-risk infants currently receive RSV prophylaxis with palivizumab, a humanized RSV monoclonal antibody (MAb). In preclinical in vitro and in vivo (cotton-rat model) studies, motavizumab, a new RSV MAb, was shown to have greater anti-RSV activity than palivizumab. Motavizumab is currently under review for licensing approval. Since both MAbs may be available concurrently, this study evaluated their safety and tolerability when administered sequentially during the same RSV season.Methods: Between April 2006 and May 2006, 260 high-risk infants were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to receive monthly intramuscular injections: 2 doses of motavizumab followed by 3 doses of palivizumab (M/P); 2 doses of palivizumab followed by 3 doses of motavizumab (P/M); or 5 doses of motavizumab (control). Adverse events (AEs, serious AEs [SAEs]), development of antidrug antibody (ADA), and serum drug trough concentrations were assessed.Results: Most children received all 5 doses (246/260 [94.6%]) and completed the study (241/260 [92.7%]). While overall AE rates were similar (mostly level 1 or 2 in severity), SAEs and level 3 AEs occurred more frequently in the M/P group (SAEs: 22.9% M/P, 8.4% P/M, 11.8% motavizumab only; level 3 AEs: 15.7% M/P, 6.0% P/M, 6.5% motavizumab only). This trend in AE rates occurred before and after switching from motavizumab to palivizumab, suggesting a cause other than the combined regimen. Frequencies of AEs judged by the investigator to be related to study drug were similar among groups. Two deaths occurred on study (both in the M/P group, before palivizumab administration); neither was considered by the site investigator to be related to study drug. Mean serum drug trough concentrations were comparable among groups; ADA detection was infrequent (5.1% or less of any group).Conclusions: The conclusions drawn from this study are limited by the small sample size per group. However, within this small study, overall AE rates, serum drug trough concentrations, and development of ADA associated with administering motavizumab and palivizumab sequentially to high-risk children appear comparable to administering motavizumab alone during the same RSV season.  2010 Fernandez et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

658,"Aetiology of childhood pneumonia in a well vaccinated South African birth cohort: A nested case-control study of the Drakenstein Child Health Study Background: Pneumonia is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in children globally. The cause of pneumonia after introduction of the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) has not been well studied in low-income and middle-income countries, and most data are from cross-sectional studies of children admitted to hospital. We aimed to longitudinally investigate the incidence and causes of childhood pneumonia in a South African birth cohort. Methods: We did a nested case-control study of children in the Drakenstein Child Health Study who developed pneumonia from May 29, 2012, to Dec 1, 2014. Children received immunisations including acellular pertussis vaccine and PCV13. A nested subgroup had nasopharyngeal swabs collected every 2 weeks throughout infancy. We identified pneumonia episodes and collected blood, nasopharyngeal swabs, and induced sputum specimens. We used multiplex real-time PCR to detect pathogens in nasopharyngeal swabs and induced sputum of pneumonia cases and in nasopharyngeal swabs of age-matched and site-matched controls. To show associations between organisms and pneumonia we used conditional logistic regression; results are presented as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs. Findings: 314 pneumonia cases occurred (incidence of 027 episodes per child-year, 95% CI 024-031; median age 5 months [IQR 3-9]) in 967 children during 1145 child-years of follow-up. 60 (21%) cases of pneumonia were severe (incidence 005 episodes per child-year [95% CI 004-007]) with a case fatality ratio of 1% (three deaths). A median of five organisms (IQR 4-6) were detected in cases and controls with nasopharyngeal swabs, and a median of six organisms (4-7) recorded in induced sputum (p=048 compared with nasopharyngeal swabs). Bordetella pertussis (OR 1108, 95% CI 133-9254), respiratory syncytial virus (805, 421-1538), or influenza virus (413, 206-826) were most strongly associated with pneumonia; bocavirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, Haemophilus influenzae, and cytomegalovirus were also associated with pneumonia. In cases, testing of induced sputum in addition to nasopharyngeal swabs provided incremental yield for detection of B pertussis and several viruses. Interpretation: Pneumonia remains common in this highly vaccinated population. Respiratory syncytial virus was the most frequently detected pathogen associated with pneumonia; influenza virus and B pertussis were also strongly associated with pneumonia. Testing of induced sputum increases the yield for detection of several organisms. New vaccines and strategies are needed to address the burden of childhood pneumonia.

659,"External validation and update of a prognostic model to predict mortality in hospitalized adults with RSV: A retrospective Dutch cohort study Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes significant mortality in hospitalized adults. Prediction of poor outcomes improves targeted management and clinical outcomes. We externally validated and updated existing models to predict poor outcome in hospitalized RSV-infected adults. In this single center, retrospective, observational cohort study, we included hospitalized adults with respiratory tract infections (RTIs) and a positive polymerase chain reaction for RSV (A/B) on respiratory tract samples (2005-2018). We validated existing prediction models and updated the best discriminating model by revision, recalibration, and incremental value testing. We included 192 RSV-infected patients (median age 60.7 years, 57% male, 65% immunocompromised, and 43% with lower RTI). Sixteen patients (8%) died within 30 days. During hospitalization, 16 (8%) died, 30 (16%) were admitted to intensive care unit, 21 (11%) needed invasive mechanical ventilation, and 5 (3%) noninvasive positive pressure ventilation. Existing models performed moderately at external validation, with C-statistics 0.6 to 0.7 and moderate calibration. Updating to a model including lower RTI, chronic pulmonary disease, temperature, confusion and urea, increased the C-statistic to 0.76 (95% confidence interval, 0.61-0.91) to predict in-hospital mortality. In conclusion, existing models to predict poor prognosis among hospitalized RSV-infected adults perform moderately at external validation. A prognostic model may help to identify and treat RSV-infected adults at high-risk of death. (Vos L.M., l.m.vos-6@umcutrecht.nl; Oosterheert J.J.; Hoepelman A.I.M.)

660,"Improving Health Care Management Through Persistent Homology of Time-Varying Variability of Emergency Department Patient Flow Excessive admissions at the emergency department (ED) is a phenomenon very closely linked to the propagation of viruses. It is a cause of overcrowding for EDs and a public health problem. The aim of this work is to give EDs' leaders more time for decision making during this period. Based on the admissions time series associated with specific clinical diagnoses, we will first perform a detrended fluctuation analysis to obtain the corresponding variability time series. Next, we will embed this time series on a manifold to obtain a point cloud representation and use topological data analysis through persistent homology technic to propose two early real-time indicators. One is the early indicator of abnormal arrivals at the ED whereas the second gives the information on the time index of the maximum number of arrivals. The performance of the detectors is parameter dependent and it can evolve each year. That is why we also propose to solve a biobjective optimization problem to track the variations of this parameter.

661,"Mortality caused by influenza and respiratory syncytial virus by age group in England and Wales 1999-2010 Background: The mortality burden caused by influenza cannot be quantified directly from death certificates because of under-recording; therefore, the estimated number of influenza deaths has to be obtained through statistical modelling. Objective: To estimate the number of deaths caused by influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in England and Wales between 1999 and 2010 using a multivariable regression model. Methods: Generalised linear models were used to estimate weekly deaths by age group (<15, 15-44, 45-74 and 75+years) as a function of positive influenza and RSV isolates. Adjustment was made for temperature variation (using weekly means of daily Central England temperature time series), underlying seasonal variation and temporal trends. The parameters from the model were used to predict the number of deaths caused by influenza and RSV across winter seasons. Results: Between 7000 and 25000 deaths across all ages were associated with influenza in the winter periods 1999-2009. The mortality burden was the highest among the over 75 age group, among whom 25-81% of deaths were caused by influenza. The lowest number of influenza deaths was estimated for the winter 2009/2010 when pandemic influenza A/H1N1 (2009) was the predominant circulating strain. RSV accounted for 5000-7500 deaths each winter season. Conclusions: The model presented provides a robust and reasonable approach to estimating the number of deaths caused by influenza and RSV by age group at the end of each winter.  2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

663,"Respiratory syncytial virus: Current and emerging treatment options Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an important respiratory pathogen in infants and children worldwide. Although RSV typically causes mild upper respiratory infections, it frequently causes severe morbidity and mortality, especially in premature infants and children with other chronic diseases. Treatment of RSV is limited by a lack of effective antiviral treatments; however, ribavirin has been used in complicated cases, along with the addition of intravenous immune globulin in specific patients. Vaccination strategies for RSV prevention are heavily studied, but only palivizumab (Synagis) has been approved for use in the United States in very select patient populations. Research is ongoing in developing additional vaccines, along with alternative therapies that may help prevent or decrease the severity of RSV infections in infants and children. To date, we have not seen a decrement in RSV morbidity and mortality with our current options; therefore, there is a clear need for novel RSV preventative and therapeutic strategies.

664,"Respiratory syncytial virus hospitalizations in healthy preterm infants Background: Studies have explored the risk for and impact of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection requiring hospitalization among healthy preterm infants born at 29-35 weeks of gestational age not given RSV immunoprophylaxis. We performed a systematic review and qualitative synthesis of these studies. Methods: Two experienced reviewers used prespecified inclusion/exclusion criteria to screen titles/abstracts and full-text studies using MEDLINE, Embase, BIOSIS and Cochrane Library (January 1, 1985, to November 6, 2014). We abstracted data on risk factors for RSV hospitalization, incidence and short- and long-term outcomes of RSV hospitalization. Using standard procedures, we assessed study risk of bias and graded strength of evidence (SOE). Results: We identified 4754 records and reviewed 27. Important risk factors for RSV hospitalization included young age during the RSV season, having school-age siblings and day-care attendance, with odds ratios >2.5 in at least one study (high SOE). Incidence rates for RSV hospitalizations ranged from 2.3% to 10% (low SOE). Length of hospital stays ranged from 3.8 to 6.1 days (low SOE). Recurrent wheezing rates ranged from 20.7% to 42.8% 1 to 2 years after RSV hospitalization (low SOE). Conclusions: Young chronological age and some environmental risk factors are important clinical indicators of an increased risk of RSV hospitalization in healthy preterm infants 32 to 35 weeks of gestational age. SOE was low for estimates of incidence of RSV hospitalizations, in-hospital resource use and recurrent wheezing in this population. Studies were inconsistent in study characteristics, including weeks of gestational age, age during RSV season and control for confounding factors.

665,"Respiratory syncytial virus activity--United States, 2003-2004. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) (i.e., bronchiolitis and pneumonia) among young children, resulting in an estimated 51,000-82,000 hospitalizations annually. RSV causes severe disease among older adults and persons of all ages with compromised respiratory, cardiac, or immune systems, and can exacerbate chronic cardiac and pulmonary conditions. In temperate climates, RSV infections occur primarily during annual winter season outbreaks. This report summarizes trends in RSV activity reported to the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) during July 2003-June 2004 and presents preliminary data from the weeks ending July 3-December 4, 2004, indicating the onset of the 2004-05 RSV season. Health-care providers should consider RSV in the differential diagnosis for persons of all ages with LRTIs, implement appropriate isolation precautions to prevent nosocomial transmission, and provide appropriate immune prophylaxis to eligible children, including certain premature infants or children and infants with chronic lung and heart disease.

666,"Preventive and therapeutic strategies for respiratory syncytial virus infection. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) remains an important cause of pneumonitis in infants and in the elderly and immunosuppressed. Passive immunoprophylaxis of high-risk infants with the humanised monoclonal antibody palivizumab reduces RSV-related hospitalisation and admission to intensive care units by about 50%, although optimal and cost-effective use of this agent remains undefined. The development of an RSV vaccine is the focus of much research and recent advances with live attenuated vaccines are promising--several agents are in clinical trials. The value of the only therapeutic agent available to treat established infection, the antiviral ribavirin, is now seriously doubted and the agent is little used. New RSV chemotherapeutics are just entering clinical trials. (Vujovic O.; Mills J.) Macfarlane Burnet Centre for Medical Research, Fairfield, Victoria, Australia."
667,"Prevention of respiratory syncytial virus infections. Respiratory syncytial virus is the most important cause of viral lower respiratory illness in infants and children worldwide. By the age of 2 years, nearly every child has become infected with respiratory syncytial virus and re-infections are common throughout life. Most infections are mild and can be managed at home, but this virus causes serious diseases in preterm children, especially those with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Respiratory syncytial virus has also been recognized as an important pathogen in people with immunossupressive and other underlying medical problems and institutionalizated elderly, causing thousands of hospitalizations and deaths every year. The burden of these infections makes the development of vaccines for respiratory syncytial virus highly desirable, but the insuccess of a respiratory syncytial virus formalin-inactivated vaccine hampered the progress in this field. To date, there is no vaccine available for preventing respiratory syncytial virus infections, however, in the last years, there has been much progress in the understanding of immunology and immunopathologic mechanisms of respiratory syncytial virus diseases, which has allowed the development of new strategies for passive and active prophylaxis. In this article, the author presents a review about novel approaches to the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus infections, such as: passive immunization with human polyclonal intravenous immune globulin and humanized monoclonal antibodies (both already licensed for use in premature infants and children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia), and many different vaccines that are potential candidates for active immunization against respiratory syncytial virus.

668,"Soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sCD25) and interleukin-10 plasma concentrations are associated with severity of primary respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection The role of the immune response in the severity of RSV infection was examined by determining plasma concentrations of interferon- (IFN-), interleukin-10 (IL-10), interleukin-2 receptor (sCD25) and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor II (sTNFR-II) in 196, previously healthy infants, during acute and convalescence phases of primary RSV infection. The results were analyzed separately for days 1-4 (early) and days 5-7 (late) of symptoms before sample collection and according to disease severity (105 hypoxic, 91 non-hypoxic). Significant associations between plasma levels and severity were found in early samples only. IL-10 and sCD25 concentrations were higher (p=0.01, each) in hypoxic compared with non-hypoxic infants, whereas no differences were observed in IFN- and sTNFR-II levels between the groups. Early sCD25 levels correlated positively with IL-10 concentrations (p=0.0003; r=0,401). Amongst the hypoxic infants, the number of days of oxygen supplementation correlated positively with early IL-10 levels (p=0.009; r=0.495) and negatively with the IFN-/IL-10 ratio (p=0.007; r=0.495). IFN- levels were significantly higher in the acute phase than during convalescence for hypoxic and non-hypoxic infants, while IL-10 levels were significantly higher in the acute phase only in hypoxic infants for days 1-4 (early; p=0.0007). sCD25 concentrations were elevated only in hypoxic infants at days 1-4 of the acute phase (p=0.002), whereas sTNFR-II levels did not vary between acute and convalescence phases, independent of severity and time point of sampling. We found no association between plasma levels during the convalescence phase and the severity of the RSV infection. (Fernandez J.A., jfernand@med.uchile.cl) Devmtl.

669,"Measuring respiratory syncytial virus infection severity in hospitalized children using the Pediatric Respiratory Syncytial Virus Electronic Severity and Outcome Rating System (PRESORS) Background: The Pediatric Respiratory Syncytial Virus Electronic Severity and Outcome Rating System (PRESORS) was developed to assess the severity of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in children. Because young children cannot report how they feel or function, ratings are based on observations by the child's caregiver (Observer-Reported Outcome questionnaire [ObsRO]) and clinician (Clinician-Reported Outcome questionnaire [ClinRO]). This prospective study aimed to evaluate the psychometric properties of the PRESORS. Methods: The PRESORS version 6 ObsRO and ClinRO were evaluated in children with RSV infection requiring hospitalization in centers in the United States, Argentina, and Chile. Assessments were performed from days 1 to 7 by the child's caregiver and clinician. To assess inter-rater reliability, two clinicians independently performed the ClinRO near in time. Results: A total of 124 children aged 36 months were enrolled (mean age, 8 months). Factor analysis demonstrated that RSV severity consists of two dimensions, respiratory signs and illness behavior, and that these dimensions were consistent over time. The inter-rater reliability for the ClinRO was 0.66 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.550.75) but improved to 0.79 (95% CI, 0.710.86) after removing one outlying site, suggesting that quantifying RSV severity is not trivial, even using qualified raters, but that an adequate inter-rater reliability is achievable with the PRESORS through adequate training. ClinRO and ObsRO displayed acceptable internal consistency and acceptable convergent validity with the Respiratory Syncytial Virus Network Scale, global impression scores, and key hospital characteristics. Conclusions: The PRESORS is relevant and appropriate for assessing the severity of RSV infection in infants requiring hospitalization. (Vandendijck Y., yvanden2@its.jnj.com; Heerwegh D.; Fennema H.)

671,"Independent lung ventilation in a newborn with asymmetric acute lung injury due to respiratory syncytial virus: A case report Introduction: Independent lung ventilation is a form of protective ventilation strategy used in adult asymmetric acute lung injury, where the application of conventional mechanical ventilation can produce ventilator-induced lung injury and ventilation-perfusion mismatch. Only a few experiences have been published on the use of independent lung ventilation in newborn patients. Case presentation: We present a case of independent lung ventilation in a 16-day-old infant of 3.5 kg body weight who had an asymmetric lung injury due to respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis. We used independent lung ventilation applying conventional protective pressure controlled ventilation to the less-compromised lung, with a respiratory frequency proportional to the age of the patient, and a pressure controlled high-frequency ventilation to the atelectatic lung. This was done because a single tube conventional ventilation protective strategy would have exposed the less-compromised lung to a high mean airways pressure. The target of independent lung ventilation is to provide adequate gas exchange at a safe mean airways pressure level and to expand the atelectatic lung. Independent lung ventilation was accomplished for 24 hours. Daily chest radiograph and gas exchange were used to evaluate the efficacy of independent lung ventilation. Extubation was performed after 48 hours of conventional single-tube mechanical ventilation following independent lung ventilation. Conclusion: This case report demonstrates the feasibility of independent lung ventilation with two separate tubes in neonates as a treatment of an asymmetric acute lung injury.  2008 Di Nardo et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

672,"Encephalopathy associated with respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis Respiratory syncytial virus is an extremely common cause of childhood respiratory infections resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Although apnea is a well-known complication in young infants with respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis, the encephalopathy associated with this infection is not well recognized. Our study reveals an incidence of encephalopathy of 1.8% in a total of 487 patients with respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis studied over a period of almost 4 years. Seizures were the presenting complication. Based on our study of a cohort of children with respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis, we believe that neurologic complications, although relatively uncommon, represent a significant component of this common childhood illness. Furthermore, respiratory syncytial virus has been shown to release several mediators that could directly or indirectly be neurotoxic and induce an encephalopathy associated with the respiratory illness.

673,"Respiratory syncytial virus in hospitalized children. A 3-year study Objective: To assess the prevalence of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and other important respiratory viruses in children hospitalized in a pediatric hospital in Paris (France) during a 3-year period (2001 to 2004). Patients and Methods: The study included all patients aged 8 days to 16 years admitted from the community through emergency department with bronchiolitis, pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infection, asthma or acute isolated fever and who had nasopharyngeal samples taken for viral identification by immunofluorescence (RSV, influenza, para-influenza, and adenoviruses). Results: A virus was found in 464 of 1208 patients with samples taken. RSV was identified in 375 patients, 74% of them younger than 6 months and diagnosed with bronchiolitis. RSV was isolated more often than any other virus, overall and for all diagnoses except ""isolated fever,"" for which influenza was more frequent. In patients aged 24 months or older, influenza and RSV were identified at the same frequency. Overall, influenza virus was found in 53 patients, adenoviruses in 24 and para-influenza viruses in 11. Conclusion: RSV was the respiratory virus isolated most often, even in older children, during this 3-year study. The relative rarity of hospitalizations due to para-influenza viruses is characteristic of this area, compared with some other countries.{A textbox is presented}{A textbox is presented}.  2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

RSV is a leading cause of hospitalization in infants in industrialized and developing countries, has been causally linked to recurrent wheezing during childhood, associated with pediatric asthma, and is an important cause of mortality in the first months of life in the developing world. Significant changes in the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and severe consequences of LRTI may emerge in the next decade with the advent of novel preventive strategies against RSV.

675,"Respiratory syncytial virus infection in elderly adults Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is now recognised as a significant problem in elderly adults. Epidemiological evidence indicates the impact of RSV in older adults may be similar to nonpandemic influenza, both in the community and in long-term care facilities. Attack rates in nursing homes are approximately 5-10% per year with significant rates of pneumonia (10-20%) and death (2-5%). Estimates using US healthcare databases and viral surveillance results over a 9-year period indicate that RSV infection causes approximately 10 000 all-cause deaths annually among persons >64 years of age. In contrast, influenza A accounted for approximately 37 000 yearly deaths in the same age group. The clinical features of RSV infection may be difficult to distinguish from those of influenza but include nasal congestion, cough, wheezing and low-grade fever. Older persons with underlying heart and lung disease and immunocompromised patients are at highest risk for RSV infection-related pneumonia and death. Diagnosis of RSV infection in adults is difficult because viral culture and antigen detection are insensitive, presumably because of low viral titres. The combination of serology and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay offers the best sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of RSV but unfortunately these techniques are not widely available; consequently, most adult RSV disease goes unrecognised. Although treatment of RSV infection in the elderly is largely supportive, early therapy with ribavirin and intravenous -globulin improves survival in immunocompromised persons. An effective RSV vaccine has not yet been developed. Therefore, prevention of RSV is limited to standard infection control practices, such as hand washing and the use of gowns and gloves.  2005 Adis Data Information BV. All rights reserved.

678,"Molecular epidemiology of respiratory syncytial virus. OBJECTIVE: To determine the epidemiologic pattern of subgroups A and B and genotypes of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) during two noncontinuous epidemics during 1990-1991 and 1997-1998 in Beijing. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal secretion (NPS) samples of RSV positive or RSV isolates tested by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) assay were classified into subgroups A and B. Isolates of RSV were divided into at least six different lineages, designated NP1-NP6, by restriction mapping of the N gene. Np1, 3 and 6 were given by subgroup B isolates, while NP2, 4 and 5 were given by subgroup A isolates. Strains of subgroup A were further subdivided into six lineages SHL1-SHL6 on the basis of the SH gene sequence. SH lineages were closely related to each other and to NP1-NP6. Strains of SHL1, 3 and 4 were closely related and belonged to NP2, SHL2 and 6 to NP4, and SHL5 to NP5. RESULTS: Of 145 RSV NPS samples from the 1997-1998 epidemic, 83 (57.2%) were of subgroup B RSV positive, 62 (42.8%) of subgroup A RSV positive. The rate of occurrence of subgroup A to B strains was about 1:1.3. Two of 10 isolates during the epidemic were subgroup A strains, whereas 8 were subgroup B strains. The rate of occurrence of subgroup A to B strains was 1:4. Eight subgroup A strains of 10 isolates from the 1990-1991 epidermic were dominant; the proportion of subgroup A to B strains was 4:1. With 10 RSV isolates in 1997-1998, all 2 subgroup A strains gave N gene fragment restriction pattern NP4, and fell into SH lineage SHL2, whereas 8 subgroup B strains all belonged to NP3. All 8 subgroup A isolates from the 1990-1991 epidemic gave pattern NP4, and fell into SHL2, while 2 subgroup B strains all belonged to NP3. The classification of subgroups A and B deduced from NP patterns corresponded to the definition of these subgroups by monoclonal antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: These observations confirm that subgroups A and B or multiple lineages of RSV co-circulated in Beijing, but different genome types predominated each year. Moreover, very similar viruses were isolated up to more than 5 years ago, indicating that despite apparent diversity of the subgroup A strains, the separate lineages might be relatively stable.

679,"Respiratory syncytial virus prevention: past and present strategies. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common cause of respiratory illness in young children, almost all will have been infected by the age of two years old. Very young infants, and those with underlying disease, are at risk of severe RSV disease, but even those who were previously healthy can suffer recurrent respiratory symptoms 9 to 10 years after their initial infection. The management of RSV infection is essentially supportive, thus prophylaxis offers the best hope of reducing the morbidity and mortality of RSV infection. There is no safe and effective RSV vaccine to use in those infants who are at highest risk from the infection. Immunoprophylaxis, however, has been shown to have benefits in randomised controlled trials. Standard immunoglobulin, however, is ineffective as its administration does not achieve an adequate titre of neutralising antibodies. RSV immunoglobulin (RSV-IGIV, RespiGam, Massachusetts Public Health Laboratories, Boston, MA), in contrast, contains high levels of RSV neutralising antibody and has been shown to significantly reduce hospitalisation in preterm infants with or without bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Its use is not recommended in infants with cyanotic congenital heart disease (CHD), as it was associated with an excess of adverse events. A humanised RSV monoclonal antibody (Palivizumab, MEDI-493, Synagis, MedImmune Inc, Gaithersburg, MD) also significantly reduces hospitalisation for RSV infection in high risk infants, but without serious side effects. The American Academy of Paediatrics has recommended that immunoprophylaxis should be considered for young children at high risk of severe RSV infection and that palivizumab is the preferred agent. Studies have suggested it is essential to carefully select patients for immunoprophylaxis, if its use is to be cost-effective. (Greenough A.; Thomas M.)

681,"Respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis in children Bronchiolitis is a common lower respiratory tract infection in infants and young children, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of this infection. RSV is transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets either directly from an infected person or self-inoculation by contaminated secretions on surfaces. Patients with RSV bronchiolitis usually present with two to four days of upper respiratory tract symptoms such as fever, rhinorrhea, and congestion, followed by lower respiratory tract symptoms such as increasing cough, wheezing, and increased respiratory effort. In 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics updated its clinical practice guideline for diagnosis and management of RSV bronchiolitis to minimize unnecessary diagnostic testing and interventions. Bronchiolitis remains a clinical diagnosis, and diagnostic testing is not routinely recommended. Treatment of RSV infection is mainly supportive, and modalities such as bronchodilators, epinephrine, corticosteroids, hypertonic saline, and antibiotics are generally not useful. Evidence supports using supplemental oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturation; however, continuous pulse oximetry is no longer required. The other mainstay of therapy is intravenous or nasogastric administration of fluids for infants who cannot maintain their hydration status with oral fluid intake. Educating parents on reducing the risk of infection is one of the most important things a physician can do to help prevent RSV infection, especially early in life. Children at risk of severe lower respiratory tract infection should receive immunoprophylaxis with palivizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, in up to five monthly doses. Prophylaxis guidelines are restricted to infants born before 29 weeks gestation, infants with chronic lung disease of prematurity, and infants and children with hemodynamically significant heart disease.

682,"Respiratory syncytial virus infections in previously healthy working adults During 1975-1995, a total of 2960 healthy adults, 18-60 years of age, were prospectively evaluated for respiratory virus infections. Of these subjects, 211 (7%) acquired respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. The infections were symptomatic in 84% of subjects, involved only the upper respiratory tract in 74%, and included lower respiratory tract symptoms in 26%. Overall, 40% of the subjects were febrile. Lower respiratory tract signs developed in 26%. RSV illnesses were more prolonged than non-RSV respiratory illnesses. Compared with influenza, RSV infections were less frequently associated with fever and headache, but were associated significantly more often with nasal congestion, ear and sinus involvement, and productive cough. Absence from work during the acute phase of the illness resulted from 38% of RSV infections and 66% of influenza cases. The mean duration of RSV illness (9.5 days), however, was significantly longer than that of influenza (6.8 days). The occurrence of annual epidemics of RSV, the virus' potential to reinfect all age groups, and the morbidity associated with these reinfections suggest that RSV infections in working adults may result in appreciable costs for medical visits and absence from work.

683,"Respiratory syncytial virus seasonality in tropical Australia OBJECTIVE: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is most common during the rainy season in a number of low- to middle-income tropical settings, a pattern driven by seasonal changes in climate and nutrition. We investigated the seasonality of RSV in the high-income tropical setting of North Queensland, Australia.METHODS: We used RSV hospital admissions data from Cairns and Townsville to assess the seasonality of RSV. We examined the seasonal scale associations between selected meteorological exposures and RSV admissions using cross-correlation of weekly data.RESULTS: In both Cairns and Townsville, RSV admissions were highest in the latter half of the rainy season. In Cairns, RSV admissions were most strongly correlated with rainfall four weeks previously. In Townsville, RSV admissions were most strongly correlated with rainfall six weeks previously.CONCLUSIONS: The seasonality of RSV in the tropical setting of North Queensland appears to be driven by seasonal variations in rainfall. Further research is needed to assess the impact of climate on RSV incidence in the tropics. (Paynter S.; Ware R.S.; Sly P.D.; Weinstein P.; Williams G.)

684,"Determination of genetic characterization and circulation pattern of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) in children with a respiratory infection, Tehran, Iran, during 2018-2019 The RSV-associated disease accounts for a significant health burden particularly in infants and young children who need to be hospitalized. Since continuous surveillance of circulating RSV genotypes is crucial worldwide, this study aimed to investigate the genetic diversity of RSV circulating strains causing upper or lower acute respiratory infection. Our attention was geared towards studying the cases hospitalized or outpatient in children younger than 2 years of age in Iran during 2018/2019. In this study, nasopharyngeal swabs collected from 206 children who presented with respiratory infection symptoms, were admitted to the referral pediatric ward of Bahrami children's hospital in Tehran, Iran. RSV-positive samples were detected via Nested RT-PCR. The glycoprotein gene was sequenced, and virus genotypes were confirmed through phylogenetic analysis by the MEGA X program. A total of 74 (35.92%) samples tested positive for RSV. Among them, sequencing was done in 10 specimens from 2018 (RSV-A: RSV-B=4:6) and 19 specimens from 2019 (RSV-A: RSV-B=16:3). According to phylogenetic analysis, all RSV-A strains were assigned as ON1 genotype and RSV-B strains were assigned as BA9 genotype. A new N-glycosylation site in Iranian BA9 and positive selection in ON1 genotype was observed. Phylogenetic characterization of strains in the current study revealed co-circulation of ON1 and BA9 as the only prevalent genotypes of both RSV-A and B groups.

Ribavirin, an antiviral agent, is licensed for severe RSV infection, although systematic reviews find it of no benefit. Passive protection against RSV can be achieved through monthly intramuscular injections of the humanised monoclonal anti-RSV antibody palivizumab (Synagis), and yields a 55% reduction in RSV hospitalisation in susceptible infants. This review assesses immunoglobulin treatment of RSV infection rather than its role as a prophylactic measure. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of adding human or humanised immunoglobulin therapy to supportive therapy in infants hospitalised with laboratory-determined RSV infection. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, 2006, issue 1) which contains the Acute Respiratory Infections Group's specialized regsiter, MEDLINE (1966 to Week 4, January 2006) and EMBASE (1980 to September 2005). We also ran searches of reference lists of relevant trials and review articles and searches of personal files. We did not impose any language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared immunoglobulin treatment with a placebo control in children hospitalised for RSV infection with bronchiolitis or pneumonia or other lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) with laboratory-documented RSV infection. The primary outcomes of interest were mortality, length of hospitalisation, length of ventilation and oxygen dependence. Secondary outcome measures were pulmonary function and re-hospitalisations for recurrent breathing difficulties in subsequent years. Any adverse effects of the treatments were also noted, for example, hypersensitivity reactions. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted but cross-comparison was not possible due to the shortage of studies and lack of comparative measurements. MAIN RESULTS: Four papers fitted the search criteria. None demonstrated statistically significant benefit of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment added to supportive care compared with supportive care alone. The evidence does not support a role for RSVIG in such a setting, with the doses used in the studies. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The evidence on the role of respiratory syncytial virus immunoglobulin (RSVIG) in treating RSV severe infections is limited. Future research might consider using stronger titres of neutralising antibodies; and further analyse severely ill children (who might respond differentially compared to those less ill, but yet hospitalised).

686,"Respiratory syncytial virus-related bronchiolitis in Puerto Rico. BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an important cause of respiratory tract disease in infants and young children. Immunoprophylaxis is available for high-risk infants. This study reviews infants with bronchiolitis at three primary care hospitals to describe the epidemiology of RSV infection in Puerto Rico. METHODS: We analyzed data from 2 hospitals by obtaining the number of infants diagnosed with bronchiolitis and estimating the percentage of cases due to RSV. A third hospital included patients with confirmed RSV infection. RESULTS: There were 4,557 patients in the study. RSV infection occurred throughout the year. Data shows a progressive decrease in RSV-positive infections. CONCLUSIONS: Data confirms year-round incidence of RSV in Puerto Rico. A standardized surveillance system in Puerto Rico is imperative to determine RSV epidemiology. The decrease in positive RSV infections may be due to the introduction of immunoprophylaxis to high-risk patients.

687,"Risk factors for respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis admissions Aim Determine the seasonal incidence of hospital Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) bronchiolitis and explore the variables associated with admission to ward versus the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU). Method Retrospective case-control study. Children, aged 2 years, between November and March, over a 3 year period with a positive RSV nasopharyngeal aspirate test. Results A total of 557 children were included; 19% (n=106) required PICU admission. Children admitted to the PICU were younger in age, median (IQR) 6.93 (3.96, 11.89) weeks compared to children who remained on the wards 11.00 (5.86, 24.14) weeks. Being underweight at the point of admission (adjusted odds ratio 3.15, 95% 1.46, 6.70, p=0.003) was associated with a PICU admission. Conclusion Number of RSV bronchiolitis hospitalisations are increasing each year. Age, weight and the use of HFNC were independent predictors for PICU admission.

688,"Respiratory syncytial virus infection in adults PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Respiratory syncytial virus has increasingly been recognized as a clinically significant cause of respiratory tract infections in adults, especially among the elderly and the immunocompromised. RECENT FINDINGS: Advances in molecular diagnostic methods have enabled rapid diagnosis of respiratory syncytial virus for clinical and epidemiological studies. Recent reports focus on clinical, immunological, and/or radiographic characterizations of respiratory syncytial virus infection in adults, particularly in hospitalized patients and those with underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and therapeutic and prophylactic use of antiviral agents in immunocompromised adults. Respiratory syncytial virus vaccine development remains a high priority, with the testing of genetically engineered live attenuated vaccines leading to further insights into the pathogenesis of respiratory syncytial virus in adults. SUMMARY: Further studies are necessary to elucidate the pathogenesis and immune response against respiratory syncytial virus in adults. The significant burden of respiratory syncytial virus-induced disease in adults and the limited number of approved antiviral agents reinforce the need to develop a respiratory syncytial virus vaccine.  2008 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

689,"Aptamers for respiratory syncytial virus detection The identification of the infectious agents is pivotal for appropriate care of patients with viral diseases. Current viral diagnostics rely on selective detection of viral nucleic acid or protein components. In general, detection of proteins rather than nucleic acids is technically more suitable for rapid tests. However, protein-based virus identification methods depend on antibodies limiting the practical applicability of these approaches. Aptamers rival antibodies in target selectivity and binding affinity, and excel in terms of robustness and cost of synthesis. Although aptamers have been generated for virus identification in laboratory settings, their introduction into routine virus diagnostics has not been realized, yet. Here, we demonstrate that the rationally designed SELEX protocol can be applied on whole virus to select aptamers, which can potentially be applied for viral diagnostics. This approach does not require purified virus protein or complicated virus purification. The presented data also illustrate that corroborating the functionality of aptamers with various approaches is essential to pinpoint the most appropriate aptamer amongst the panel of candidates obtained by the selection. Our protocol yielded aptamers capable of detecting respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), an important pathogen causing severe disease especially in young infants, at clinically relevant concentrations in complex matrices.

690,"Respiratory syncytial virus and premature infants born at 32 weeks' gestation or earlier: Hospitalization and economic implications of prophylaxis Objectives: To assess the risk of hospitalization associated with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and to estimate the economic impact of RSV prophylaxis with either RSV immune globulin (RSV-Ig) or RSV monoclonal antibody (palivizumab) on a cohort of preterm infants born at 32 weeks' gestation or earlier. Design: Historical cohort study. Setting: A 12-county neonatal network served by the regional center in Rochester, NY. Participants: One thousand twenty-nine infants born at 32 weeks' gestation or earlier followed up until 1 year of corrected age. Main Outcome Measures: Rate of hospitalization with an RSV-associated illness; Cost per hospitalization prevented resulting from either form of RSV prophylaxis. Results: The probability of hospitalization with an RSV-associated illness for infants born at 32 weeks' gestation or earlier was estimated at 11.2%. The incidence of RSV hospitalization increased with decreasing gestational age (13.9% vs 4.4% for infants born at 26 weeks' gestation vs those born at 30-32 weeks' gestation). Infants requiring respiratory support at 36 weeks of postconceptual age (PCA) or older had a higher hospitalization rate (16.8% vs 6.2%), longer hospital stays, and higher hospital charges than infants requiring respiratory support at less than 36 weeks of PCA. For infants requiring respiratory support at less than 36 weeks of PCA, the incidence of RSV hospitalization still increased with decreasing gestational age (10.2% vs 4.3% for infants 26 weeks' gestation vs those 30-32 weeks' gestation). Analysis indicated that both forms of RSV prophylaxis would increase the net cost of care for all groups. Palivizumab was more cost-effective than RSV-Ig for preventing RSV hospitalization among infants who required respiratory support at less than 36 weeks of PCA, especially those born at 26 weeks' gestation or earlier. Overall, RSV-Ig was more cost-effective than palivizumab for infants requiring respiratory support at 36 weeks of PCA or older. Conclusions: This analysis suggests that available forms of RSV prophylaxis would increase the net cost of care not only for the entire cohort but for each of the subgroups studied. However, the RSV hospitalization rate and the cost-effectiveness of prophylaxis varied markedly by subgroup. (Stevens T.P., bowlesroad@msn.com; Sinkin R.A.; Maniscalco W.M.)

691,"Economic evaluation of possible prevention of RSV-related hospitalizations in premature infants in Germany Palivizumab (Synagis, MedImmune Inc./Abbott Laboratories) has been shown to reduce the number of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-related hospitalizations in premature infants. The cost-effectiveness ratio of this prophylaxis, however, has not been evaluated in the German health-care system to date. The aim of the study was to assess the costs and benefits of Palivizumab among premature infants  35 weeks with different risk factors. Projecting a societal perspective, we used decision analysis to compare the strategies of a prophylaxis with and without Palivizumab. Probabilities and costs of hospitalization were derived from a retrospective, population-based cohort study on 1,103 prematurely born infants primarily admitted to nine neonatologic care units in southern Germany between November 1998 and October 1999. Costs of prophylaxis were based on hospital sources. Efficacy of prophylaxis and estimates of RSV mortality were derived from the literature. Effectiveness was defined as the number of averted hospitalizations. The cost-effectiveness ratio of Palivizumab varied strongly among the different risk groups. While demonstrating no net cost savings related to RSV prophylaxis for any of the risk groups analyzed, Palivizumab showed the best cost-effectiveness ratio among male infants with chronic lung disease, discharge from primary neonatal care between October and December, and the presence of siblings visiting a day-care group. One averted hospitalization in this high-risk group was associated with costs of Euro 6,639 (number needed to treat (NNT): 4). For infants in other risk groups, the ratios varied from Euro 25,288 (NNT: 8) to Euro 204,684 (NNT: 54) per hospitalization averted. The cost-effectiveness ratios were sensitive to varying assumptions about probabilities and costs of rehospitalization, efficacy, and costs of Palivizumab prophylaxis. Conclusions: The results of this cost-effectiveness analysis do not justify the widespread use of Palivizumab among preterm infants. Lowering the costs of prophylaxis would be the most direct way to improve the cost-effectiveness ratio of Palivizumab. (Roeckl-Wiedmann I.; Grill E.) Inst. Med.

692,"Hospital admissions and need for mechanical ventilation in children with respiratory syncytial virus before and during the COVID-19 pandemic: a Danish nationwide cohort study Background: The incidence of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) increased in several countries after the relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions. We aimed to investigate the age-related risk of RSV-associated hospital admissions and need for mechanical ventilation during the RSV resurgence in summer and autumn 2021 compared with the four RSV seasons preceding the COVID-19 pandemic. We also aimed to describe the clinical complications necessitating mechanical ventilation. Methods: This population-based cohort study included patients aged 017 years admitted to hospital with RSV in Denmark during the RSV resurgence in summer and autumn 2021, and the four pre-COVID-19 RSV seasons (201617, 201718, 201819, and 201920). We retrieved data on RSV-associated hospital admissions from the Danish National Patient Registry and demographic and clinical details of children who received mechanical ventilation through prospective real-time data collection in 202122 and retrospective data collection for the 201617 to 201920 RSV seasons from all eight paediatric and neonatal intensive care units in Denmark. Risk factors for severe RSV disease were as defined as age younger than 3 months or severe comorbidities. We calculated the risk of RSV-associated hospital admissions per 100 000 population in each RSV season from week 21 to week 20 of the following year. We also calculated the risk rate of receiving mechanical ventilation per 100 000 population and 1000 RSV-associated hospital admissions during each RSV season from week 21 to week 20 of the following year. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) for hospital admission and mechanical ventilation by dividing the risk rate of hospital admission and mechanical ventilation in 202122 by annual mean risk rates in the four pre-COVID-19 RSV epidemics (201617 to 201920). We compared RRs using Fisher's exact test. We compared complications leading to intubation between children with and without risk factors for severe RSV disease. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05186597. Findings: Among 310 423 Danish children aged younger than 5 years, the mean number of RSV-associated hospital admissions increased from 1477 (SD 226) in the 201617 to 201920 RSV seasons to 3000 in the 202122 RSV season (RR 20 [95% CI 1921]). 54 children with RSV received mechanical ventilation in 202122 compared with 1528 annually in the 201617 to 201920 RSV seasons (23 [1633]). The highest increase in hospital admissions and need for mechanical ventilation occurred among children aged 2459 months (41 [3647] for hospital admission; 46 [17126] for mechanical ventilation). Among children admitted to hospital, the risk of mechanical ventilation was similar in 202122 and the four pre-COVID-19 seasons (risk rate 143 per 1000 RSV-associated hospital admissions [95% CI 104193] vs 129 [101161]; RR 11 [95% CI 0816]). Across all RSV seasons studied, among children younger than 3 months or those with severe comorbidities, respiratory failure due to bronchiolitis led to mechanical ventilation in 69 (79%) of 87 children. Of 46 children with no risk factors for severe RSV, 40 (87%) received mechanical ventilation due to additional complications, including neurological (n=16; 35%), cardiac (n=1; 2%), and pulmonary complications (n=23; 50%; eg, wheeze responsive to bronchodilator therapy, severe bacterial co-infections, and pneumothorax). Interpretation: In Denmark, RSV disease did not seem to be more severe for the individual child during the RSV resurgence in 2021 following relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions. However, hospital admissions were higher among older children, possibly due to a postponed first RSV infection or no recent reinfection. Older children without risk factors for severe RSV disease had atypical complications that led to intubation. If new RSV-preventive interventions for healthy infants delay first RSV infection, a higher number of older children might be admitted to hospital due to atypical clinical phenotypes, rather than classical bronchiolitis.

Recent discoveries regarding the neutralization-specific viral epitopes of the pre-fusion RSV glycoprotein have led to a shift from empirical to structure-based design of RSV therapeutics, and controlled human infection model studies have provided early-stage proof of concept for novel RSV monoclonal antibodies, vaccines and antiviral drugs. The worlds first vaccines and first monoclonal antibody to prevent RSV among older adults and all infants, respectively, have recently been approved. Large-scale introduction of RSV prophylactics emphasizes the need for active surveillance to understand the global impact of these interventions over time and to timely identify viral mutants that are able to escape novel prophylactics.

In immunosuppressed individuals, progression from upper respiratory tract disease to pneumonia is common, and usually fatal if left untreated. We performed a retrospective analysis of RSV infections in recipients of autologous or allogeneic transplants. The incidence of RSV following allogeneic or autologous HSCT was 5.7% and 1.5%, respectively. Of the 58 patients with an RSV infection, 16 of 21 patients identified within the first post-transplant month, developed pneumonia. Seventy-two percent of patients received aerosolized ribavirin and/or RSV-IGIV, including 23 of 25 patients diagnosed with RSV pneumonia. In this aggressively treated patient population, three patients died of RSV disease, each following an unrelated HSCT.

Most infants who experience wheezing episodes also exhibit evidence of an ongoing respiratory viral infection. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection in children and is a common cause of wheezing in infants and young children. In the past several decades, a number of studies have demonstrated a relationship between infants with severe RSV infections and the subsequent development of asthma later during childhood. This review provides an overview of data that suggests a severe RSV infection early in childhood is linked to development of asthma later in life.

Materials and Methods: The study was conducted between 1 December 2012 and 1 March 2013 in our pediatric clinic. A total of 170 children between 1-24 months of age with lower respiratory tract infection were included. Their clinical and laboratory findings were analyzed retrospectively. The detection of RSV antigen was carried out by immunoassay method on nasopharyngeal swabbing samples. Results: RSV infection was determined in 37.1% of the patients. RSV (+) patients under the age of 6 months was statistically significantly higher than RSV (-) patients. In RSV (+) and RSV (-) patients there was no statistically significantly difference in gender, infiltration in chest radiography, C-reactive protein positivity, white blood cell count, platelets, insufficient breast feeding, three or more than three siblings, history of upper respiratory tract infection in the family, maternal and family smoke exposure. Conclusions: In this study, patients between 1-24 months of the age admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infections, that highly consistent with the literature (37.1%) were RSV infection. In the determination of RSV infection, taking the necessary measures in isolation of this infection provide access block transmission between patients and contribute reducing unnecessary use of antibiotics.

698,"Respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis and the ""special population"" Bronchiolitis is the most frequent airway infection in the first 2 years of life, and the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most frequently responsible virus. In selected high-risk groups, RSV may cause severe respiratory disease leading to hospitalization, need for mechanical ventilation, and even death. These high-risk groups include children with congenital heart disease, infants with neuromuscular impairment, cystic fibrosis, Down Syndrome, immunodeficiency syndromes and others specific conditions. In these high-risk populations defined in literature as ""special population"", a 3- to 10-fold increase in the rate of RSV hospitalization has been observed, justifying RSV specific prophylaxis with palivizumab, a monoclonal antibody that binds a viral glycoprotein epitope and blocks the link between RSV and target cell. Evidence of safety and efficacy of RSV prophylaxis in these populations is lacking. Given the low incidence of these conditions, randomized clinical trials are not feasible. The purpose of this paper is to give an update from the literature of various conditions at higher risk to develop severe RSV infection, and to offer an overview of the efficacy of palivizumab in preventing RSV infection in these specific populations.

699,"Respiratory Syncytial Virus infection in adult populations Respiratory Syncytial Virus, generally recognized for its role as the major respiratory pathogen in newborn infants and young children, is also a significant pathogen in adults. It is a frequent cause of upper and lower respiratory illness among all age groups, although it often goes unrecognized in adults unless highly sensitive molecular diagnostic tests are used. All RSV infections in adults represent re-infection and are generally mild to moderate in severity, although persons with certain high-risk conditions are susceptible to severe disease. These include the frail elderly living at home or in long term care facilities, those with underlying chronic pulmonary disease, and the severely immunocompromised. It is estimated that between 11,000-17,000 adults die of RSV infection annually in the U.S, with ~ ten-fold more admitted to hospital with respiratory symptoms. As in infants, wheezing is often noted during RSV infections and chest radiographs are often normal despite significant lower respiratory symptoms and hypoxia. Treatment of RSV is directed at symptomatic relief, and only rarely is specific antiviral therapy recommended. Exceptions include the severely immunocompromised, in whom inhaled ribavirin has been recommended in hopes of reducing both mortality and long term pulmonary compromise, especially in lung transplant recipients. Immunity to RSV is incomplete. Although there does not appear to be a defect in humoral immunity, there is evidence that CD8+ T cell immunity may be impaired with age. Currently a vaccine for RSV is not available, and many challenges to developing a successful vaccine must be overcome.  2012 Bentham Science Publishers.

700,"Respiratory syncytial virus consortium in Europe (RESCEU) birth cohort study: Defining the burden of infant respiratory syncytial virus disease in Europe Background. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes significant morbidity and mortality in infants worldwide. Although prematurity and cardiopulmonary disease are risk factors for severe disease, the majority of infants hospitalized with RSV are previously healthy. Various vaccines and therapeutics are under development and expected to be available in the near future. To inform the use of these new vaccines and therapeutics, it is necessary to determine the burden of RSV disease in Europe. We will prospectively follow-up a birth cohort to obtain incidence data on RSV acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI). Methods. Multicenter prospective study of a birth cohort consisting of 10 000 healthy infants, recruited during 3 consecutive years. RSV associated hospitalization in the first year of life will be determined by questionnaires and hospital chart reviews. A nested cohort of 1000 infants will be actively followed. In case of ARTI, a respiratory sample will be collected for RSV molecular diagnosis. Results. The primary outcome is the incidence rate of RSV-associated hospitalization in the first year of life. In the active cohort the primary outcome is RSV associated ARTI and MA-ARTI. Conclusions. We will provide key information to fill the gaps in knowledge about the burden of RSV disease in healthy infants.

701,"Hospitalisation for RSV infection in ex-preterm infants - Implications for use of RSV immune globulin Background - Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) specific immune globulin is now being marketed for prevention of RSV infection in ex-preterm infants. However, there are no published UK data on the morbidity or mortality from RSV in these infants. Aims - To determine the morbidity and mortality from RSV infection in a cohort of infants previously treated at a regional neonatal unit, and compare the cost of hospitalisation for RSV with the potential cost of administering RSV immune globulin (RSV-IG) prophylaxis. Methods - Infants born at a gestation of less than 32 weeks were studied. Details of admissions for respiratory illness in the first two years of life were collected from hospital records, referring hospital, and general practitioners. Results - Data on 82 infants were collected. Up to three RSV seasons were encountered. The hospitalisation rate for confirmed RSV infection for the first season encountered was 4%. Rates of ward and paediatric intensive care unit admission were higher for infants with chronic lung disease. There were no deaths from RSV. RSV-IG would not have been cost effective for more infants. Conclusion - The morbidity and mortality rates from RSV observed in this group do not support the widespread introduction of RSV-IG prophylaxis for ex-preterm infants.

702,"Immunoprophylaxis of respiratory syncytial virus: global experience. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infects nearly all children by age 2 years, and it causes considerable illness and death in certain high-risk pediatric populations. Historically, treatment for RSV has been symptomatic, and developing a safe and effective vaccine has been a challenge. Therefore, research efforts have turned to passive immunization as the best option to control RSV. Palivizumab, a genetically engineered humanized monoclonal antibody, has been shown to reduce RSV-related hospitalizations significantly, with few adverse effects. It was approved for use in high-risk children in the USA in 1998 and in Europe in 1999; it is now approved for use in more than 45 countries. The efficacy and safety of palivizumab continue to be supported by both clinical trial and outcomes data. (Simoes E.A.)

703,"Bacteraemia and antibiotic use in respiratory syncytial virus infections Aims: To examine the frequency of and risk factors for bacteraemia in children hospitalised with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection; and to determine current use of antibiotics in hospitalised children with RSV infection. Methods: Retrospective study of all children, aged 0-14 years, admitted to a tertiary children's hospital with proven RSV infection over a four year period. Children with concurrent bacteraemia and RSV infection were identified, and risk factors examined for bacteraemia. The case notes of a randomly selected comparison sample of 100 of these RSV infected children were examined to assess antibiotic use and population incidence of risk factors for severe RSV infection. Results: A total of 1795 children had proven RSV infection, and blood cultures were sent on 861 (48%). Eleven (0.6%) of the 1795 RSV positive children had bacteraemia. RSV positive children had a significantly higher incidence of bacteraemia if they had nosocomial RSV infection (6.5%), cyanotic congenital heart disease (6.6%), or were admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit (2.9%). Forty five (45%) of the random comparison sample of RSV infected children received antibiotics. Conclusions: Bacteraemia is rare in RSV infection. Children with RSV infection are more likely to be bacteraemic, however, if they have nosocomial RSV infection, cyanotic congenital heart disease, or require intensive care unit admission.

704,"Respiratory syncytial virus infection after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. The occurrence of lower respiratory tract infection is associated with a poor prognosis, especially in the early post transplant period. In the winter period of 2009, two of our patients developed a RSV pneumonia at respectively 6 and 13 months post stem cell transplantation. In both cases an extensive pulmonary disease quickly developed. Both patients were treated with ribavirin. One died as a direct result of the RSV pneumonia, the other patient recovered. RSV infection needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis of fever and respiratory symptoms as well early after stem cell transplantation as in the late post transplant period. A rapid initiation of therapy, ideally before respiratory failure, may improve the outcome of a RSV pneumonia. To facilitate the decision which patients with RSV infection of the upper respiratory tract would most benefit from treatment, more research has to be executed and prognostic factors identified.

705,"Respiratory syncytial virus infection: Therapy and prevention RSV is the primary cause of hospitalisation in the first year of life for children in most parts of the world, and nearly 100% of children in the USA are infected with the virus by 2 to 3 years of age. The agent is an enveloped RNA virus with a non-segmented single-stranded negative-sense genome. The viral genome encodes 8 structural and 2 non-structural proteins. Important structural proteins include the fusion (F) protein and the attachment (G) protein which are essential for viral penetration and attachment to the host cells. Both proteins are important in development of immune responses. The virus is estimated to cause 3000 to 4000 deaths annually. Primary infections are as a rule symptomatic. The spectrum of clinical manifestations ranges from mild upper tract illness, infection in middle ear which progresses to acute otitis media, croup, to apnoea in premature infants, pneumonia and bronchiolitis. Premature babies born at 30-35 weeks of gestation, infants with cyanotic congenital heart disease, HIV-infected subjects, and patients on intensive immunosuppressive therapy especially after bone marrow transplant are considered to be at risk for increased mortality and morbidity during RSV infection. The virus does not normally replicate outside of the bronchopulmonary tree and the infection is exquisitely restricted to the respiratory mucosa. However, development of extrapulmonary disease has been observed in certain T and B cell immunodeficiency states. The association of RSV with asthma and reversible reactive airway disease in early childhood has attracted significant attention. Recurrent wheezing for up to 5 to 7 years of age and established airway disease has been observed in a significant number of children with a strong family history of allergy, after primary infection or reinfection with RSV. Immune response to primary infection is relatively small but on reinfection, a significant booster effect with sustained immunologic reactivity is observed in serum and respiratory mucosa. Both CD(4)- and CD(8)-specific as well as Th(1)- and Th(2)-cell specific immune responses have been observed during human infection. In addition, proinflammatory as well as immunoregulatory cytokines and chemokines are induced in the respiratory tract after natural and induced (in vitro) infection. Significant progress has been made in understanding the role of Th(1) vs. Th(2), IgE, viral induced cytokines and chemokines in the mechanisms of pathogenesis of the disease, development of wheezing and in the prevention and treatment of the infection and its sequelae. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the commonest human viral infections, and virtually every child is infected by the third birthday. Because of its restricted mucosal immunopathology, and frequent association with bronchial hyperreactivity and development of wheezing, RSV has served as an important model to investigate mechanisms of mucosal immune responses and development of mucosal disease following infection. The importance of RSV in bronchopulmonary disease and development of bronchial hyperreactivity has been the focus of several recent symposia [Kimpen JL, Simoes EAF. Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2001; 163:S1-S6]. This brief report will only summarise, based on selected references, the historical landmarks of its discovery and current understanding of the mechanisms of immunity, and their possible role in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary disease.  2004 Elsevier Science Ltd.

706,"Respiratory syncytial virus infection: Clinical features, management, and prophylaxis Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infects almost all children by two years of age, resulting in a large number of hospital admissions in infants. Reactive airway disease is more common after RSV infection, even in previously healthy children. Management of the acute infection is supportive, but preliminary evidence suggests surfactant administration to ventilated infants may be of benefit. Whether ribavirin or corticosteroids reduce respiratory morbidity after RSV infection remains controversial. Immunoprophylaxis reduces RSV admissions, Palivizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, is a more cost-effective prophylaxis than RSV immune globulin. Nevertheless, the cost of prophylaxis, unless only given to very high-risk infants, exceeds savings made in reducing admissions.  2002 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc. (Greenough A.)

707,"Primary respiratory syncytial virus infection in mice OBJECTIVE: To establish a mice-model of primary respiratory syncytial virus infection. METHODS: Twelve Balb/c mice (8-12 w) were divided into two groups with three different titers of RSV infection in the experimental group. Mice were anaesthetized with pentobabitone(30 mg/kg) and infected by nasal drip of 0.1 ml of RSV which was harvested from HEP-2 cell culture. Three mice in the control group received sham infection with HEP-2 cell media. Five days later, lungs were removed in aseptic condition. Right lung was weighted and homoginized with MEM(1:10 ratio), then centrifuged at 4 degrees C, 2,000 r/min for 20 minutes. Supernatants were collected for virus isolation and plaque forming assay. Left lung was collected for histopathological and electromicroscopic examination. RESULTS: (1) RSV grew with a characteristic syncytial formation in HEP-2 cells, leading to the fusion of cells with round, elliptic, map or tree like shape. (2) Virus was isolated and detected in the lung tissue in experiment group. (3) There was a positive correlation between RSV titer added and that replicated in the lung. (4) After the eclipse phase, viral replication in the lung reached maximum within 4 and 6 days. The most apparent pathological change was found between day 5 and 8. Mononuclear cell infiltration was presented in the perivascular, peribronchial and in the alveoli spacers. (5) Huge viral replication with its fuzzy coat was detected inside the cytoplasm of the type II alveolar lining cell at high magnification. CONCLUSION: An animal model of RSV infection Balb/c mice was successfully established by nasal inoculation with respiratory syncytial virus. (Zou Y.; Huang H.; Xu J.)

708,"Respiratory Syncytial Virus Seasonality - United States, 2014-2017 Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection in young children worldwide (1-3). In the United States, RSV infection results in >57,000 hospitalizations and 2 million outpatient visits each year among children aged <5 years (3). Recent studies have highlighted the importance of RSV in adults as well as children (4). CDC reported RSV seasonality nationally, by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) regions* and for the state of Florida, using a new statistical method that analyzes polymerase chain reaction (PCR) laboratory detections reported to the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) (https://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/nrevss/index.html). Nationally, across three RSV seasons, lasting from the week ending July 5, 2014 through July 1, 2017, the median RSV onset occurred at week 41 (mid-October), and lasted 31 weeks until week 18 (early May). The median national peak occurred at week 5 (early February). Using these new methods, RSV season circulation patterns differed from those reported from previous seasons (5). Health care providers and public health officials use RSV circulation data to guide diagnostic testing and to time the administration of RSV immunoprophylaxis for populations at high risk for severe respiratory illness (6). With several vaccines and other immunoprophlyaxis products in development, estimates of RSV circulation are also important to the design of clinical trials and future vaccine effectiveness studies.

709,"Respiratory syncytial virus infection: Therapy and prevention Very little is available in the way of specific therapy for RSV infection. Bronchodilators, corticosteroids and ribavirin are certainly not cost-effective measures. Fortunately most infants with RSV infection can be successfully managed with fluid resuscitation and supplemental oxygen. Even in cases of respiratory failure, mortality is uncommon if assisted ventilation is provided early on in the course of illness. New approaches to treatment may involve combinations of antiviral compounds and immune modulators, or may be addressed at relieving the prominent mucus plugging of the airway in bronchiolitis. However the critical immunologic pathways to be upregulated or inhibited have yet to be identified. A key element of treatment strategies may be intervention during the time when the child is experiencing only URI symptoms, before wheezing begins. Serious RSV-related illness can be prevented in high-risk infants with the use of passive prophylaxis. However this option is far too expensive to apply to infants with only an average risk of hospitalisation for RSV infection. The advent of an effective RSV vaccine is many years in the future. Specific measures to prevent RSV infection are therefore not available. Parents should be instructed in the practice of hand washing before having contact with their newborn infants, and older siblings with URI symptoms should be kept away from infants. In multicenter studies of RespiGam and palivizumab, the incidence of RSV hospitalisation in control groups declined over the years that studies were conducted (Figure 2). This suggests that education of parents in basic infection control techniques can prevent serious RSV infection in infants.  2004 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

710,"Respiratory Syncytial Virus in Otherwise Healthy Prematurely Born Infants: A Forgotten Majority Healthy, premature infants 35 weeks' gestational age (wGA) are universally recognized to be at an increased risk of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Serious respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract infection imposes an additional burden of illness on these infants following hospitalization. Incurred morbidities relative to term infants include longer lengths of hospital stay, admission to intensive care, and need for oxygen and mechanical ventilation, all of which are associated with increased hospital costs. The highest morbidities are experienced by premature infants who are youngest (<3 months' chronological age) and are of lower gestational age. Short- and long-term follow-up indicates that healthy preterm infants both of lower gestational age and who are late preterm have obstructive lung function at baseline, which is further compromised by RSV-related infection during infancy. There is increasing evidence that childhood exposure to an episode of RSV infection may set the stage for an abnormal respiratory function trajectory, which, in adulthood, leads to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Healthy premature infants <32 wGA merit RSV prophylaxis based on existing data, whereas moderate- and high-risk preterm infants 32 to 35 wGA should be selectively and cost-effectively targeted for prophylaxis using validated risk scoring tools and country-specific thresholds for funding.

711,"The contribution of child, family and health service factors to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) hospital admissions in the first 3 years of life: Birth cohort study in Scotland, 2009 to 2015 Introduction: Several vaccines for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are under development. Designing an effective vaccination programme for RSV requires information about the relative contribution of risk factors for severe RSV symptoms. Aim: To inform preventive strategies in Europe by quantifying the contribution of key child, family and health service risk factors to the burden of RSV hospital admissions in young children. Methods: We constructed a birth cohort study of all singleton children born in Scotland between October 2009 and September 2012 using linkage between birth registration, maternity, vaccination and hospital admission records, with follow-up until the age of 3 years. RSV-confirmed hospital admissions were defined using linkage to national laboratory surveillance data. We estimated hospital admission rates per 1,000 child years and length of stay according to each risk factor. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios.Results: There were 5,185 RSV admissions among the 169,726 children in the cohort: 48.6% of admissions occurred before the age of 6 months, and 29.6% after the age of 1 year. Children born prematurely, small for gestational age, between July and December, with chronic conditions, older siblings, mothers < 30 years old or delayed infant vaccination had a significantly increased risk of admission. Minimising the risk posed by older siblings could reduce RSV admissions by up to 34%. Conclusion: Future RSV vaccination programmes must protect children throughout early childhood. Vaccination and/or interventions to reduce transmission by older siblings could substantially reduce RSV hospital admissions.

712,"Does a therapeutic conversation intervention in an acute paediatric setting make a difference for families of children with bronchiolitis caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)? Aims and objectives: To measure the benefit of a short-family therapeutic conversation (STC) intervention in an acute paediatric unit. Background: Studies of children with bronchiolitis caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) have shown that this virus may have an impact on their respiratory system in the form of a wheezing disorder, asthma and even allergy during their childhood. Studies of the parents of these children indicate that they experience distress, vulnerability and anxiety through the illness period and therefore need support from healthcare professionals. However, little is known about what intervention is of most benefit for these parents. Design: Quasi-experimental. Method: Data were collected from a convenience sample from February throughout April 2009 at an acute unit at a children's hospital in Iceland. Parents of infants diagnosed with bronchiolitis caused by RSV were invited to attend. In total, there are 41 participants: 21 in the intervention group (n = 21) and 20 in the control group (n = 20). Parents in both groups answered questionnaires about perceived support and family expressive functioning both before the intervention and on an average of 11 days after the intervention. Results: The main findings showed that mothers in the intervention group perceive significantly higher support after the intervention compared with the control group. The findings also showed a significant difference between the genders (mothers and fathers) in the intervention group. The mothers perceived higher cognitive support than the fathers. Conclusions: Despite the often chaotic environment in an acute care setting, the research findings give paediatric nurses reason to conclude that a STC intervention benefits mothers of infants with bronchiolitis caused by RSV. Relevance to clinical practice: A STC intervention offered by a nurse within an acute paediatric unit can support families in handling the illness experience.  2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

713,"Respiratory Complications in Children Hospitalized with Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection The goal of this study was to define the prevalence of respiratory complications, other than bronchiolitis, such as pneumonia, acute otitis media, and conjunctivitis in children treated in a hospital due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, with reference to the plausible risk factors. The study included 111 children, aged up to 22 months (median 3 months). Complications were observed in 68 (61%) children, with 32 (29%) children presenting more than one. The most frequent complication was acute otitis media in 53 (48%), pneumonia in 37 (33%), and conjunctivitis in 12 (11%) out of the 111 children. Children with complications were older than those without complications and had fever that lasted for a significantly longer time, both before and during hospitalization, and the fever was stronger. They also presented a significantly lower breathing rate at admission. The age over 3 months was a single risk factor associated with the development of otitis media (OR = 9.8, 95%CI: 3.626.7) and pneumonia (OR = 2.8, 95%CI: 1.17.3). Other factors such as prematurity, birth weight below 2500 g, exposure to tobacco smoke during pregnancy, and the cessation of breastfeeding below age 6 months were statistically irrelevant to this end. We conclude that complications are very frequent in hospitalized children with RSV infection and their risk increases with the infant age.

To date, ribavirin (Virazole, ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) remains the only therapeutic agent approved for the treatment of RSV. However, its clinical benefits are small and occur only in a fraction of RSV-infected patients. The prophylactic administration of palivizumab (SynagisTM, MedImmune, Inc.) is problematic and costly and, therefore, only recommended for use in high-risk infants.

715,"Severity of influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus coinfections in hospitalized adult patients Background: With the introduction of molecular diagnostic techniques over the past decades, different kinds of viral pathogens in the same sample are detected simultaneously more frequently. Nevertheless, influenza virus (Flu) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) coinfection in adults was reported only occasionally. Moreover, the clinical implications of Flu/RSV coinfection in the respiratory tract of adults remain unclear. Methods: This retrospective study analyzed adult patients with acute respiratory infection from January 2017 to June 2019 in China-Japan Friendship Hospital. Results: A total of 574, 235 and 113 patients were positive for influenza A-only (FA-only), influenza B-only (FB-only) and RSV-only in influenza seasons (from Nov 2017 to Mar 2018 and from Nov 2018 to Mar 2019), respectively. Of these, 19 cases were coinfected by Flu and RSV and admitted to this hospital. Compared with 809 Flu-only infected patients and 113 RSV-only infected patients, both the rates of intensive care unit(ICU) admission and use of invasive mechanical ventilation in Flu/RSV coinfected patients were higher (ICU admission: 47.4% vs. 20.1%, P=0.004; 47.4% vs. 22.1%, P=0.020; invasive mechanical ventilation: 47.4% vs.13.2%, P<0.001; 47.4% vs. 17.7%, P=0.004). Furthermore, 60-day all-cause mortality attributed to Flu/RSV coinfections was significantly greater than that for Flu and RSV mono-infected patients (36.8% vs. 8.0%,P<0.001; 36.8% vs. 11.5%, P=0.004.

716,"Respiratory syncytial virus infections in Central Australia Background: Little is known about the epidemiology of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in arid desert regions and in the Aboriginal population. We describe the seasonality and epidemiology of RSV infection in Central Australia, an arid area with a large Aboriginal population. Methods: Five-year retrospective study from 2000 through 2004 of children less than 2 years old admitted to Alice Springs Hospital with documented RSV infection. Results: RSV infection was documented in 173 children <2 years old admitted over a 5-year period, 165 community-acquired and 8 nosocomial. The annual incidence rate of community-acquired RSV infection in hospitalised Central Australian children <2 years old was 20.4 per 1000. The rate in Aboriginal children of 29.6 per 1000 children was significantly greater than in non-Aboriginal children of 10.9 per 1000 (P < 0.0001). Associated risk factors were common; 52% of infected children had at least one other comorbidity. Younger children had more severe illness and longer duration of hospital stay. RSV-related illness peaked in winter but infections occurred throughout the year, and the winter predominance was less marked than in temperate climates. Conclusions: In the arid, desert region of Central Australia, RSV infection occurs throughout the year, but is more frequent in winter and more common in Aboriginal children.

Design: Prospective observational study. Setting: Twenty-two-bed Paediatric Intensive Care Unit. Patients: Forty-eight ventilated children with RSV-positive LRTI. Measurements and results: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were measured daily. In patients with elevated transaminase levels infection with the following viruses was investigated: hepatitis A, B and C viruses, cytomegalovirus, Epstein Barr virus, adenovirus, influenza virus, and parainfluenza viruses (types I, II, and III). Elevated transaminase levels were detected in 22 (46%) patients. The duration of mechanical ventilation (geometric mean; 95% CI) was significantly (P<0.05) longer in the group with elevated transaminase levels: 10.6 (9.4; 11.7) days versus 3.5 (2.8; 4.2) days. This difference remained significant in patients without congenital heart disease. Inotrope use was more common and all deaths occurred in the group with elevated transaminase levels (P<0.05). All patients who died and all but two patients with inotrope requirements had underlying congenital heart disease. One patient with elevated transaminase levels had a simultaneous infection with influenza A virus. Conclusions: RSV disease in ventilated children was more severe if transaminase levels were elevated. Transaminase level elevation was due to hepatitis in the majority of patients. In patients with congenital heart disease we also detected myocardial involvement. (Eisenhut M., michael_eisenhut@yahoo.com; Thorburn K.; Ahmed T.) Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, Roy.

718,"Product review on the monoclonal antibody palivizumab for prevention of respiratory syncytial virus infection Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) accounts for about 20% of all respiratory infections in children below the age of 5 y. It is associated with up to 63% of all acute respiratory infections and up to 81% of all viral lower respiratory tract infections causing hospitalization in infants and young children. RSV leads to seasonal epidemics between November and April in the northern hemisphere. Most severe infections (RSV accounts for 50 to 80% of all cause bronchiolitis) affect infants younger than 6 months of age and high-risk infants including those born preterm with or without bronchopulmonary dysplasia and those with hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease up to an age of 24 months. Palivizumab, a highly potent RSV-neutralizing monoclonal antibody (Mab), has been licensed in 1998 for prophylactic use to prevent RSV associated hospitalizations in high-risk infants. This Mab is given by monthly intramuscular injection at a dose of 15 mg/kg over the RSV season (up to 5 times). Palivizumab proved to be safe and well-tolerated in this population. Concerns have been raised regarding cost-effectiveness of palivizumab and thus, palivizumab prophylaxis is mainly limited to selected high-risk infants for the first RSV season. Long-lasting Mabs will be the next future approach in the prophylaxis of RSV hospitalization until a vaccine is developed.

719,"Respiratory syncytial virus-coded pediatric hospitalizations, 1997 to 1999 Background. The recent number and rate of infant hospitalizations with a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-coded diagnosis have not been published. Methods. Retrospective data analysis. National Hospital Discharge Survey data for 1997 to 1999 were analyzed for discharges of infants <1 year old with an RSV-coded diagnosis (ICD-9-CM 466.11, 480.1, 079.6). Hospitalization rates were estimated with annual midyear Census data. Results. RSV bronchiolitis was the leading primary diagnosis annually for all infants hospitalized for any reason. Between 1997 and 1999, 297 684 RSV-coded discharges of infants with an RSV-coded diagnosis occurred. The associated hospitalization rate was 25.2 per 1000 infants. RSV-coded discharges peaked in February. Conclusion. RSV bronchiolitis was the leading cause of hospital admissions of infants younger than age 1 year for any reason between 1997 and 1999.

720,"Host Components Contributing to Respiratory Syncytial Virus Pathogenesis Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most prevalent viral etiological agent of acute respiratory tract infection. Although RSV affects people of all ages, the disease is more severe in infants and causes significant morbidity and hospitalization in young children and in the elderly. Host factors, including an immature immune system in infants, low lymphocyte levels in patients under 5 years old, and low levels of RSV-specific neutralizing antibodies in the blood of adults over 65 years of age, can explain the high susceptibility to RSV infection in these populations. Other host factors that correlate with severe RSV disease include high concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukins (IL)-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, and thymic stromal lymphopoitein (TSLP), which are produced in the respiratory tract of RSV-infected individuals, accompanied by a strong neutrophil response. In addition, data from studies of RSV infections in humans and in animal models revealed that this virus suppresses adaptive immune responses that could eliminate it from the respiratory tract. Here, we examine host factors that contribute to RSV pathogenesis based on an exhaustive review of in vitro infection in humans and in animal models to provide insights into the design of vaccines and therapeutic tools that could prevent diseases caused by RSV.

721,"Th17 lymphocytes in respiratory syncytial virus infection Infection by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) affects approximately 33 million infants annually worldwide and is a major cause of hospitalizations. Helper T lymphocytes (Th) play a central role in the immune response during such infections. However, Th lymphocytes that produce interleukin 17 (IL-17), known as Th17 lymphocytes, in addition to been protective can also cause pathology that accompany this type of infection. The protective effects of Th17 is associated with better prognosis in most infected individuals but heightened Th17 responses causes inflammation and pathology in others. Studies employing animal models haves shown that activated Th17 lymphocytes recruit neutrophils and facilitate tertiary lymphoid structure development in infected lungs. However, IL-17 also inhibits the ability of CD8+ lymphocytes to clear viral particles and acts synergistically with the innate immune system to exacerbate inflammation. Furthermore, IL-17 enhances IL-13 production which, in turn, promotes the activation of Th2 lymphocytes and excessive mucus production. Studies of these animal models have also shown that a lack of, or inadequate, responses by the Th1 subset of T lymphocytes enhances Th17-mediated responses and that this is detrimental during RSV co-infection in experimental asthma. The available evidence, therefore, indicates that Th17 can play contradictory roles during RSV infections. The factors that determine the shift in the balance between beneficial and adverse Th17 mediated effects during RSV infection remains to be determined.  2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

722,"Impact of breastfeeding on the incidence and severity of respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis in infants: systematic review BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Breastfeeding practices have demonstrated a protective effect against severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease outcomes. RSV is the principal cause of lower respiratory tract infections in infants worldwide, and an important cause of morbidity, hospitalization, and mortality. The primary aim is to determine the impact of breastfeeding on the incidence and severity of RSV bronchiolitis in infants. Secondly, the study aims to determine if breastfeeding contributes to reduction of hospitalization rates, length of stay and oxygen use in confirmed cases. METHODS: A preliminary database search was conducted using agreed keywords and MeSH headings in MEDLINE, PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE, MedRiv and Cochrane Reviews. Articles were screened based on inclusion/exclusion criteria for infants aged 0-12 months. Full text, abstract and conference articles published in English were included from 2000 to 2021. Covidence software was used for evidence extraction using paired investigator agreement and PRISMA guidelines were followed. RESULTS: 1368 studies were screened and 217 were eligible for full text review. 188 were excluded. Twenty-nine articles were selected for data extraction: RSV-bronchiolitis (18) and viral bronchiolitis (13), with two articles discussing both. Results showed that non-breastfeeding practices are a significant risk factor for hospitalization. Exclusive breastfeeding for >4-6 months significantly lowered admission rates, length of stay and supplemental oxygen use, reducing unscheduled GP visits and emergency department presentation. DISCUSSION: Exclusive and partial breastfeeding reduce severity of RSV bronchiolitis, length of hospital stay and supplemental oxygen requirement. Breastfeeding practices should be supported and encouraged as a cost-effective method to prevent infant hospitalization and severe bronchiolitis infection.

723,"The health and economic burden of respiratory syncytial virus associated hospitalizations in adults Background Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is increasingly recognized as an important cause of illness in adults; however, data on RSV disease and economic burden in this age group remain limited. We aimed to provide comprehensive estimates of RSV disease burden among adults aged 18 years. Methods During 2012-2015, population-based, active surveillance of acute respiratory infection (ARI) hospitalizations enabled estimation of the seasonal incidence of RSV hospitalizations and direct health costs in adults aged 18 years in Auckland, New Zealand. Results Of 4,600 ARI hospitalizations tested for RSV, 348 (7.6%) were RSV positive. The median (interquartile range) length of hospital stay for RSV positive patients was 4 (2-6) days. The seasonal incidence rate (IR) of RSV hospitalizations, corrected for non-testing, was 23.6 (95% confidence intervals [CI] 21.0-26.1) per 100,000 adults aged 18 years. Hospitalization risk increased with age with the highest incidence among adults aged 80 years (IR 190.8 per 100,000, 95% CI 137.6-244.0). Being of Maori or Pacific ethnicity or living in a neighborhood with low socioeconomic status (SES) were independently associated with increased RSV hospitalization rates. We estimate RSV-associated hospitalizations among adults aged 18 years to cost on average NZD $4,758 per event. Conclusions RSV infection is associated with considerable disease and economic cost in adults. RSV disproportionally affects adult sub-groups defined by age, ethnicity, and neighborhood SES. An effective RSV vaccine or RSV treatment may offer benefits for older adults. (Prasad N., Namrata.Prasad@esr.cri.nz; Newbern E.C., Claire.Newbern@esr.cri.nz; Jelley L.; Aminisani N.; Huang Q.S.)

724,"Respiratory syncytial virus: Spectrum of clinical manifestations and complications in children Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection in infants and young children. Despite its substantial disease burden, no effective vaccine is available. Clinical manifestations of RSV encompass the spectrum of acute upper and lower respiratory tract infection. Hallmarks of the virus are its propensity to progress to lower respiratory disease and to cause disproportionate disease severity at extremes of ages. Acute RSV infection may be complicated by secondary bacterial infections and respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and prolonged hospitalization. In the developed world, most RSV infections are self-limited; however, globally, RSV is a significant cause of mortality in children younger than age 5 years. Severe RSV infection in infancy has also been associated with the development of childhood asthma. Thus, the extensive disease burden of RSV and its attributable mortality portend the urgency of vaccine development targeted toward populations disproportionately affected by severe disease.

725,"Respiratory syncytial virus infection: Determinants of disease severity Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) remains the leading cause of hospitalization in infancy and is increasingly recognized as an important pathogen in older adults and children. RSV infection is associated with a wide spectrum of clinical response, from mild upper respiratory tract infection to life-threatening bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Both viral and host factors seem to be important in determining the clinical response to RSV infection. Viral load, as assessed by quantitative culture of nasal specimens, has been shown to correlate with disease severity in some but not all studies. Similarly, the two major antigenic groups of RSV have been inconsistently associated with increased disease severity. Recent data have raised the possibility that geno-typic differences between strains may affect RSV virulence and the pattern of clinical response to infection. Host factors possibly exacerbating RSV disease in infancy include small airways geometry and an atopic family history. Furthermore, the host immune response seems to play a pivotal role in determining the outcome of RSV infection. Many aspects of both the innate and adaptive immune response have been identified as important determinants of disease severity. Underlying cardiopulmonary and immunologic disease predispose to severe infection in all age groups, whereas older age per se seems to be associated with increased RSV-related morbidity and mortality. Additional comprehensive studies are needed to determine the relative importance of both viral and host factors in disease pathogenesis. (Legg J.P.; Johnston S.L.)

726,"Can we improve the targeting of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) prophylaxis in infants born 32-35 weeks gestational age with more informed use of risk factors? Objective: To evaluate the key risk factors for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) hospitalisation in 32-35 weeks gestational age (wGA) infants.Methods: Published risk factors were assessed for predictive accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [ROC AUC]) and for number needed to treat (NNT).Results: Key risk factors included: proximity of birth to the RSV season; having siblings; crowding at home; day care; smoking; breast feeding; small for GA; male gender; and familial wheezing/eczema. Proximity of birth to the RSV season appeared the most predictive. Risk factors models from Europe and Canada were found to have a high level of predictive accuracy (ROC AUC both >0.75; NNT for European model 9.5). A model optimised for three risk factors (birth 10 weeks from start of RSV season, number of siblings 2 years and breast feeding for 2 months) had a similar level of prediction (ROC AUC: 0.776; NNT: 10.2). An example two-risk factor model (day care attendance and living with 2 siblings <5 years old) had a lower level of predictive accuracy (ROC AUC: 0.55; NNT: 26).Conclusions: An optimised combination of risk factors has the potential to improve the identification of 32-35 wGA infants at heightened risk of RSV hospitalisation.

727,"Direct costs of low respiratory infection due to RSV in children under one year Introduction: Considering the high prevalence of respiratory infections in hospitalized infants with Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), the objective of this study is to determine the direct costs of this infection. Patients and Method: Prospective longitudinal study in infants under one year of age hospitalized due to RSV during 2015. The patients were divided into 2 groups, Group 1 patients without risk factors and Group 2 patients with risk factors (prematurity, oxygen dependence, bronchopulmo-nary dysplasia, heart disease, immunocompromised patients), comparing each other variables such as nutritional status, gender, breastfeeding, discharge diagnosis, radiological diagnosis, length of hospital stay, among others. Direct costs for hospitalization were estimated according to the fees of the National Health Fund (FONASA) and the Modality of Institutional Care (MAI). Results: The total patients admitted in the period were 260: 234 (90%) in Group 1 and 26 (10%) in Group 2. The average hospital stay for Group 1 was 7.3 days (SD+5.1) with a median of 6 days, and 13.6 days (SD+16.3) for Group 2 with a median of 7 days (p < 0.05). The direct costs associated with RSV hospitalization were on average CLP $ 413,529 (US$ 632.1) for Group 1, and CLP $ 744,260 (US$ 1,137.6) for Group 2 (p < 0.05). There was also statistically significant higher cost for Group 2 due to tests and drugs (p < 0.05) and costs per day of hospital stay (p < 0.05). Conclusion: These values, known for the first time in the national reality, confirm the high cost of these infections and particularly in risk groups.

Palivizumab (Synagis) is a monoclonal antibody that is administered monthly by injection to prevent RSV infection in infants at high risk. This article describes a nurse-run ambulatory clinic to provide RSV prophylaxis. Coordination with other agencies, including community neonatal intensive care units, was essential to the clinic's success. For each of its first 2 years of operation, 24 infants and their families attended the clinic once each month for 5 months throughout the RSV season.

729,"Prevention of respiratory syncytial virus: A review Antibodies mediate humoral immune responses and play key roles in the defense of viral infection by the recognition, neutralization, and elimination of viruses from the circulation. For the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, the pooled human plasma has been harvested and successfully developed as a prophylactic polyclonal RSV hyperimmune globulin, RespiGam (RSV-IGIV; MedImmune, Gaithersburg, MD). The success of RSV-IGIV validated the immunoprophylaxis approach for RSV prevention and led to the development of Synagis (palivizumab; MedImmune, Gaithersburg, MD), a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to the RSV F protein. Palivizumab is a potent anti-RSV mAb that is about 50-fold more potent than RSV-IGIV, and since obtaining regulatory approval in 1998 it has been used extensively to help prevent severe RSV disease in high-risk infants and children. However, a very small number of patients receiving the drug do not appear to be adequately protected. To further improve protection against RSV, we have applied a directed evolution approach to enhance the binding of palivizumab to F protein by assessment of both on and off rates. These efforts have yielded a more potent second-generation mAb, motavizumab, which is currently under study in phase III clinical trials. Most recently, a third generation mAb, Numax-YTE, has been generated with the intent to extend the half-life in serum of the mAb in humans. The aim of this review is to evidence the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of these drugs and to evaluate their efficacy.  2009 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

We also wanted to see whether passive smoking could be a contributory factor. Methods: In a longitudinal study, 33 children who attended the emergency room with an RSV infection (age 7 months) were compared with 37 age-matched controls recruited from routine infant check-ups. The 18-month follow-up consisted of a questionnaire focusing on environmental factors and the child's health during the last 12 months. An allergy skin prick test (SPT) was performed and venous blood was obtained. Results: The prevalence of AOM and the use of antibiotics were higher in the RSV group than in the controls (p = 0.009 and p = 0.027 respectively). The number of AOMs and the use of antibiotics correlated, r = 0.8. In the RSV group, one or both parents smoked in 52% compared with 14% in the controls (p < 0.001). There were no differences in allergy SPT results. Conclusion: The infants with RSV infection had AOM and were prescribed antibiotics more frequently during the follow-up period. Furthermore, smoking was far more common among the parents of the RSV group.

Design This is a retrospective population-based cohort study. Five outcomes were examined, including overall RSV infection, positive lab test-confirmed RSV infection, clinically diagnosed RSV diseases, RSV-associated bronchiolitis and unspecified bronchiolitis. Risk ratio (RR) and 95% CI of the outcomes that occurred during the 2022 and 2021 RSV seasons were calculated by comparing propensity-score matched cohorts. Setting Nationwide multicentre database of electronic health records (EHRs) of 61.4 million patients in the USA including 1.7 million children 0-5 years of age, which was accessed through TriNetX Analytics that provides web-based and secure access to patient EHR data from hospitals, primary care and specialty treatment providers. Participants The study population consisted of 228 940 children of 0-5 years with no prior RSV infection who had medical encounters in October 2022. Findings were replicated in a separate study population of 370 919 children of 0-5 years with no prior RSV infection who had medical encounters in July 2021-August 2021 during a non-overlapping time period. Results For the 2022 study population (average age 2.4 years, 46.8% girls, 61% white, 16% black), the risk for incident RSV infection during October 2022-December 2022 was 6.40% for children with prior COVID-19 infection, higher than 4.30% for the matched children without COVID-19 (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.55); and among children aged 0-1 year, the overall risk was 7.90% for those with prior COVID-19 infection, higher than 5.64% for matched children without (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.62). For the 2021 study population (average age 2.2 years, 46% girls, 57% white, 20% black), the risk for incident RSV infection during July 2021-December 2021 was 4.85% for children with prior COVID-19 infection, higher than 3.68% for the matched children without COVID-19 (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.56); and 7.30% for children aged 0-1 year with prior COVID-19 infection, higher than 4.98% for matched children without (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.82). Conclusion COVID-19 was associated with a significantly increased risk for RSV infections among children aged 0-5 years in 2022. Similar findings were replicated for a study population of children aged 0-5 years in 2021. Our findings suggest that COVID-19 contributed to the 2022 surge of RSV cases in young children through the large buildup of COVID-19-infected children and the potential long-term adverse effects of COVID-19 on the immune and respiratory system.

734,"Prevalence of human respiratory syncytial virus circulating in Iran Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of acute respiratory infection during early childhood and is associated with a great burden on patients, parents, and society. While no treatment is yet available, results from recent phase 2 clinical trials of cell-entry inhibitors and RSV vaccines are promising. To prepare for introduction of these novel therapeutics, good understanding of its molecular epidemiology and continuous RSV surveillance data are necessary. This paper provides an overview of RSV prevalence and genotype distribution in Iran from 1996 to 2013. This meta-analysis includes 21 published studies. In total, 775 (18.7%) of 4140 respiratory specimens were positive for RSV infection. The male-female ratio of RSV-positive patients was 1.5:1. Significant peaks of RSV infection were detected during the cold season (November-March). RSV infection was mainly observed in patients <2 years of age. Phylogenetic studies showed that genotypes GA1, GA2, GA5, and BA co-circulated in Iran in 2007-2013. This review highlights the necessity of introducing standard molecular surveillance programs to inform the epidemiological, clinical, and pathological characteristics of various RSV genotypes. Improved understanding of the molecular epidemiology will be useful for development of novel RSV therapeutics. (Salimi V., vsalimi@sina.tums.ac.ir; Yavarian J.; Mokhtari-Azad T.)

735,"Infection with respiratory syncytial virus and possibilities of prevention Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most prominent pathogen found in respiratory tract infections in children and the most important cause of bronchiolitis in the first two years of life. In the Netherlands approximately 2000 children are admitted each winter season. A serious course is mostly seen in children younger than 3 months, (ex-)prematures, children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia or congenital cardiac anomalies, children with cystic fibrosis younger then 2 years and children with impaired T cell immunity; such cases not rarely require intensive care. Treatment (fluid, nutrition, bronchodilator agents, corticosteroids, oxygen and ventilation) is usually symptomatic. Antiviral therapy is only indicated in immunodeficient patients. For prevention by passive immunization palivizumab was recently registered in the Netherlands, a monoclonal antibody against RSV that has to be administered intramuscularly from the start of the RSV season (15 mg per kg bodyweight once a month during five months). In a number of large-scale American multicenter studies both the number of hospital admissions related to RSV infection and the mean duration of hospital stay showed a statistically significant reduction in high-risk children who had been treated with palivizumab. Palivizumab appears to be indicated in children from the categories with an increased risk for serious RSV disease. (Rothbarth Ph.H.; Kimpen J.L.L.; Roord J.J.; Neijens H.J.)

736,"The burgeoning burden of Respiratory syncytial virus among children Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was first isolated from infants by Chanock and colleagues in 1957. However, control of this ubiquitous agent has yet to be achieved. RSV is recognized as the primary cause of hospitalization for acute lower respiratory tract illness (LRTI) among infants worldwide. Among children <5 years old, annual hospitalization rates in the United States (US) is 3/1000 children, and rates in Canada and European countries are similar. In the US the hospitalization rate is 3 times higher than that from influenza or parainfluenza viral infections. Much less appreciated is the clinical and economic burden from RSV outpatients, as few have specific diagnostic testing. Nevertheless, RSV in the US is estimated to cause 1 of 334 hospitalizations, 1 of 38 emergency department visits, but 1 of 13 private practice visits. These outpatient children tend to have moderate to severe illness with approximately three-fourths manifesting labored respirations. RSV burden among outpatients, therefore, is considerable both in size and severity. The global burden of RSV infection is unknown as few studies are from developing countries. Estimates indicate about one-fourth of all acute LRTI occur among children <5 years, and the greatest burden is among children in developing countries. Currently the only approved means of RSV prophylaxis is passive immunization with humanized F protein monoclonal antibody. Such prophylaxis, however, has limited availability, is expensive, and is recommended only for infants most at risk for severe RSV disease. Only widespread immunization of children is likely to diminish the current burden of RSV infection.  2012 Bentham Science Publishers.

737,"Meteorologic conditions and respiratory syncytial virus activity BACKGROUND: The factors that determine the initiation and persistence of yearly epidemics of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis are not well known. A limited number of studies have found that meteorologic conditions could be associated with RSV activity. OBJECTIVES: We analyzed the association of certain atmospheric conditions with RSV activity, as determined by the number of hospitalizations of infants with bronchiolitis in Mallorca (Spain). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of the medical records of children  2 years of age with acute bronchiolitis between January 1995 and December 2006. Climatic data were obtained from a weather station located 15 km from the hospital. The number of RSV hospitalizations were correlated to temperature, barometric pressure, relative humidity and water vapor pressure using different time models and regression analyses. RESULTS: A total of 1495 infants with RSV bronchiolitis were hospitalized during the study period, with a seasonal pattern from November to March. Weekly RSV activity could be predicted (R= 0.88; P < 0.001) by mean temperature and atmospheric pressure. Monthly RSV activity was significantly associated (R= 0.95; P < 0.001) with mean and minimum temperature, water vapor pressure, relative humidity and barometric pressure. The peak of RSV activity was observed within 9C mean temperature, 5C minimum temperature, 16C maximum temperature, 1032 hPa atmospheric pressure, 83% relative humidity and 910 hPa water vapor pressure. CONCLUSIONS: The annual patterns of RSV hospitalizations were strongly associated with the meteorologic conditions. The mean temperature and atmospheric pressure were the main factors that correlated with increases and declines in RSV activity. Copyright  2012 by Lippincott Williams &Wilkins.

738,"Treatment and prevention of RSV bronchiolitis Respiratory syncytial virus is a leading cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children worldwide, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality in high-risk individuals. The pediatric populations at high risk for severe RSV infections include patients with cardiac disease, lung disease, immunosuppression, premature birth or healthy infants less than six months of age. Supportive care is the primary treatment of RSV lower respiratory tract infections. Other treatment regimens include the use of bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory agents; however, the use of these agents is controversial due to lack of evidence of efficacy in all studies. Ribavirin, an antiviral agent, has been administered for the treatment of RSV lower respiratory tract infections, but its efficacy has been questioned due to flawed study designs. RSV-IVIG and palivizumab are approved for the prevention of RSV infection in selected children at high risk for serious disease. These agents are equally efficacious and expensive; however, the cost-effectiveness of prophylaxis is unclear. Currently, no vaccines for RSV are available for general use, but research in the area continues. Until a safe, effective and relatively inexpensive method for prophylaxis is available, RSV infections will continue to cause significant morbidity and mortality in children. (Dominguez K.D.)

739,"Respiratory syncytial virus prevention outreach project The objective of the study is to determine whether early identification, outreach, and intervention would increase compliance with palivizumab prophylaxis for respiratory syncytial virus prevention for members of a Texas Medicaid managed care organization. The study cohort was selected from administrative claims data. The observational study period ran from October 1, 2006, to March 31, 2007. Letters, educational materials, and postcards were mailed and outbound telephone calls were placed to qualified members. In addition, letters were sent to primary care providers. Of the 1236 identified members, the 2,238 letters, educational materials, and reminder postcards mailed resulted in 1091 injections to 394 identified members. Only 10% of the 394 members completed their qualified doses as suggested by the guideline. Even with the most intensive outreach, compliance is not highly assured. We must explore other strategies to overcome barriers in this preventive medicine program. (Giardino A.P.; Tran X.G.; Whitmire D.A.)"
740,"Prospective population-based study of rsv-related intermediate care and intensive care unit admissions in Switzerland over a 4-year period (2001-2005) Objectives: : Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections are a leading cause of hospital admissions in small children. A substantial proportion of these patients require medical and nursing care, which can only be provided in intermediate (IMC) or intensive care units (ICU). This article reports on all children aged < 3 years who required admission to IMC and/or ICU between October 1, 2001 and September 30, 2005 in Switzerland. Patients and Methods: : We prospectively collected data on all children aged < 3 years who were admitted to an IMC or ICU for an RSV-related illness. Using a detailed questionnaire, we collected information on risk factors, therapy requirements, length of stay in the IMC/ICU and hospital, and outcome. Results: : Of the 577 cases reported during the study period, 90 were excluded because the patients did not fulfill the inclusion criteria; data were incomplete in another 25 cases (5%). Therefore, a total of 462 verified cases were eligible for analysis. At the time of hospital admission, only 31 patients (11%) were older than 12 months. Since RSV infection was not the main reason for IMC/ICU admission in 52% of these patients, we chose to exclude this subgroup from further analyses. Among the 431 infants aged < 12 months, the majority (77%) were former near term or full term (NT/FT) infants with a gestational age 35 weeks without additional risk factors who were hospitalized at a median age of 1.5 months. Gestational age (GA) < 32 weeks, moderate to severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and congenital heart disease (CHD) were all associated with a significant risk increase for IMC/ICU admission (relative risk 14, 56, and 10, for GA 32 weeks, BPD, and CHD, respectively). Compared with NT/FT infants, high-risk infants were hospitalized at an older age (except for infants with CHD), required more invasive and longer respiratory support, and had longer stays in the IMC/ICU and hospital. Conclusions: : In Switzerland, RSV infections lead to the IMC/ICU admission of approximately 1%-2% of each annual birth cohort. Although prematurity, BPD, and CHD are significant risk factors, non-pharmacological preventive strategies should not be restricted to these high-risk patients but also target young NT/FT infants since they constitute 77% of infants requiring IMC/ICU admission.  2008 Springer.

741,"Recombinant human deoxyribonuclease in infants with respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis Background: Treatment of hospitalized infants with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis is mainly supportive. Bronchodilators and systemic steroids are often used but do not reduce the length of hospital stay. Because hypoxia and airways obstruction develop secondary to viscous mucus in infants with RSV bronchiolitis, and because free DNA is present in RSV mucus, we tested the efficacy of the mucolytic drug recombinant human deoxyribonuclease (rhDNase). Methods: In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial, 225 oxygen-dependent infants admitted to the hospital for RSV bronchiolitis were randomly assigned to receive 2.5 mg bid of nebulized rhDNase or placebo until discharge. The primary end point was length of hospital stay. Secondary end points were duration of supplemental oxygen, improvement in symptom score, and number of intensive care admissions. Results: There were no significant differences between the groups with regard to the length of hospital stay (p = 0.19) or the duration of supplemental oxygen (p = 0.07). The ratio (rhDNase/placebo) of geometric means of length of stay was 1.12 (95% confidence interval, 0.96 to 1.33); for the duration of supplemental oxygen, the ratio was 1.28 (95% confidence interval, 0.97 to 1.68). There were no significant differences in the rate of improvement of the symptom score or in the number of intensive care admissions. Conclusions: Administration of rhDNase did not reduce the length of hospital stay or the duration of supplemental oxygen in oxygen-dependent infants with RSV bronchiolitis.

742,"Respiratory syncytial virus activity--United States, 2000-01 season. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has a worldwide distribution and can cause serious lower respiratory tract illness (LRTI). RSV is most commonly considered a pathogen among infants and young children; however, it can cause serious LRTI throughout life, especially among those with compromised respiratory, cardiac, or immune systems and the elderly. In temperate climates, RSV infections occur primarily during annual outbreaks, which peak during winter months. In the United States, RSV activity is monitored by the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS), a laboratory-based surveillance system. This report summarizes trends in RSV activity reported to NREVSS during July 2000-June 2001 and presents preliminary surveillance data from the weeks ending July 7 through December 8, 2001, indicating the onset of the 2001-02 RSV season. Health-care providers should consider RSV in the differential diagnosis of lower respiratory tract disease in persons of all ages, use isolation procedures to prevent nosocomial transmission, and consider use of immune globulin or monoclonal antibody prophylaxis in premature infants or infants and children with chronic lung disease.

743,"Transmission of respiratory syncytial virus infection within families Background. Because the production of an effective respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine for infants is challenging, vaccination of other family members is one viable alternative to prevent severe RSV illnesses in infants. Methods. In a prospective study, we enrolled all family members of children who were hospitalized with RSV infection. Nasal swabs for RSV detection were obtained from all participating family members. Data on respiratory symptoms in the family members prior to and after the child's admission were collected using standardized questionnaires. Results. At the time of or within 1 week after the index child's hospitalization, RSV was detected in 40 (77%) of the 52 families and in 60 (47%) of 129 family members. Forty-nine (82%) of RSV detections in the family members were associated with respiratory symptoms. A sibling or a parent was the probable primary case of RSV in 30 (58%) families. Respiratory syncytial virus loads in the nasal swabs were significantly higher (10(7.7)) in index children than in their parents (10(5.1), P < .0001). Conclusions. In most cases, the likely source of an infant's RSV infection is an older sibling or a parent. These findings support the strategy of reducing the burden of RSV in infants by vaccination of their family members. (Heikkinen T., terho.heikkinen@utu.fi; Valkonen H.; Ruuskanen O.)

744,"Implications of gestational age at antenatal care attendance on the successful implementation of a maternal respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine program in coastal Kenya BACKGROUND: Maternal immunisation to boost respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) specific antibodies in pregnant women is a strategy to enhance infant protection. The timing of maternal vaccination during pregnancy may be critical for its effectiveness. However, Kenya has no documented published data on gestational age distribution of pregnant women attending antenatal care (ANC), or the proportion of women attending ANC during the proposed window period for vaccination, to inform appropriate timing for delivery or estimate potential uptake of this vaccine. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted within the Kilifi Health and Demographic Surveillance System (KHDSS), coastal Kenya. A simple random sample of 1000 women who had registered pregnant in 2017 to 2018 and with a birth outcome by the time of data collection was taken. The selected women were followed at their homes, and individually written informed consent was obtained. Records of their antenatal attendance during pregnancy were abstracted from their ANC booklet. The proportion of all pregnant women from KHDSS (55%) who attended for one or more ANC in 2018 was used to estimate vaccine coverage. RESULTS: Of the 1000 women selected, 935 were traced with 607/935 (64.9%) available for interview, among whom 470/607 (77.4%) had antenatal care booklets. The median maternal age during pregnancy was 28.6 years. The median (interquartile range) gestational age in weeks at the first to fifth ANC attendance was 26 (21-28), 29 (26-32), 32 (28-34), 34 (32-36) and 36 (34-38), respectively. The proportion of women attending for ANC during a gestational age window for vaccination of 28-32 weeks (recommended), 26-33 weeks and 24-36 weeks was 76.6% (360/470), 84.5% (397/470) and 96.2% (452/470), respectively. Estimated vaccine coverage was 42.1, 46.5 and 52.9% within the narrow, wide and wider gestational age windows, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In a random sample of pregnant women from Kilifi HDSS, Coastal Kenya with card-confirmed ANC clinic attendance, 76.6% would be reached for maternal RSV vaccination within the gestational age window of 28-32 weeks. Widening the vaccination window (26-33 weeks) or (24-36 weeks) would not dramatically increase vaccine coverage and would require consideration of antibody kinetics data that could affect vaccine efficacy.

745,"Innate immune recognition of respiratory syncytial virus infection Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of respiratory infection in infants and young children. Severe clinical manifestation of RSV infection is a bronchiolitis, which is common in infants under six months of age. Recently, RSV has been recognized as an important cause of respiratory infection in older populations with cardiovascular morbidity or immunocompromised patients. However, neither a vaccine nor an effective antiviral therapy is currently available. Moreover, the interaction between the host immune system and the RSV pathogen during an infection is not well understood. The innate immune system recognizes RSV through multiple mechanisms. The first innate immune RSV detectors are the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), and nucleotide-biding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs). The following is a review of studies associated with various PRRs that are responsible for RSV virion recognition and subsequent induction of the antiviral immune response during RSV infection.

746,"Point of care testing of Influenza A/B and RSV in an adult respiratory assessment unit is associated with improvement in isolation practices and reduction in hospital length of stay Introduction. Every winter seasonal influenza and other viral respiratory infections increase pressure on the health services and are associated with nosocomial infection and morbidity. Aim. To compare provision of point-of-care (POC) testing with laboratory-based testing for influenza and RSV detection on an adult respiratory assessment unit to assess the impact on isolation practices and length of stay (LOS). Methodology. Prospective interrupted 'on-off' study in adults admitted to the respiratory unit between December 2018 and April 2019 with a suspected respiratory tract infection. Nasopharyngeal samples were tested using either the GeneXpert rapid POC test for influenza and RSV (on-period), or were sent to the laboratory for multiplex PCR testing against a panel of 12 respiratory viruses (off-period). Outcome measures were time to patient isolation for infection control, LOS and turnaround time from admission to test results. Results. Of 1145 patients evaluated, 755 were tested with POC and 390 with laboratory multiplex; a respiratory virus was identified in 164 (21.7 %) and 138 (35.4 %) patients respectively. A positive POC test was associated with a shorter time to isolation (mean difference 16.9 h, P 0.001), shorter LOS (mean difference 15.5 h, P=0.05,) and shorter turnaround time (mean difference 28.3 h, P 0.001), compared to laboratory testing. Conclusion. Use of GeneXpert POC testing for Flu/RSV is associated with rapid reporting of results with significant improvements in isolation practices and reductions in LOS.

747,"Respiratory syncytial virus infection: An emerging or unappreciated infection? Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a ubiquitous cause of respiratory infection with a worldwide distribution and seasonal occurrence. Natural immunity does not normally follow infection, and reinfection is the rule. Reinfection may even occur within a single season. Although its role in serious lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in infants is well recognized, the importance of RSV in disease of older children, adults and, especially in the elderly, is poorly appreciated. In large surveillance studies, RSV is at least as important in contributing to respiratory morbidity and mortality as influenza. These data would suggest that tens of millions of Americans suffer respiratory disease (LRTI and upper respiratory tract infection [URTI]) from RSV each winter. In addition, otitis media and episodic bronchospasm are complications following RSV infection. Unfortunately, there is no vaccine yet available for prevention. Prevention of disease with a hyperimmune globulin (RSVIG) and with a monoclonal antibody (MAb) (palivizuMab) is possible, but only for those neonates and infants at highest risk of morbidity and mortality from RSV infection. Therapy with the only approved antiviral for this indication, ribavirin, is difficult, is of questionable efficacy, and the compound itself is teratogenic. Infection by RSV constitutes an enormous but unappreciated medical need worldwide. (Shlaes D.M.) Infectious Disease Research, Wyeth-Ayerst Research, 401 N.

748,"Respiratory syncytial virus infection in elderly adults Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of severe lower respiratory tract infections in infants and young children. Reinfections are common throughout adult life with more severe presentations occurring in immunocompromised individuals, subjects with underlying high-risk cardiopulmonary diseases, and in the elderly. There is now a significant body of literature indicating that the impact of RSV in elderly adults is similar to that of non-pandemic influenza, both in the community and in nursing homes. Clinical manifestations of RSV infections are similar to those caused by other viral respiratory pathogens, including influenza viruses. Molecular tests (reverse transcription-PCR) now provide a rapid diagnosis. The sputum sample combined with nasopharyngeal swab increases the diagnostic yield. At the present time, treatment is mainly symptomatic. The prevention of RSV consists in various infection control strategies, such as standard precautions, especially hand washing and droplet precautions to limit the nosocomial spread. Vaccines and antiviral agents for the prevention and treatment of RSV infections in elderly adults are currently not available, but they are being developed.

749,"Risk factors for severe respiratory syncytial virus infection in infants Severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease is associated with unacceptable morbidity and mortality in children, especially in young children. Underlying conditions including prematurity with or without bronchopulmonary dysplasia, congenital heart disease, immunosuppression or another underlying respiratory condition, such as cystic fibrosis, increase the risk of contracting and developing severe RSV disease. Environmental factors such as crowding, day-care attendance, and exposure to passive smoke can increase the risk of severe RSV disease. Children with severe RSV disease often require intensified medical care, including hospitalization, which places a burden on the child, the family, and the health care system. There are currently no effective curative treatments for severe RSV disease. Preventive measures, such as infection control and prophylaxis, appear to be the best options in the management of RSV disease in these high-risk patients.  2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Methods: Canadian RSV Evaluation Study of Palivizumab is a prospective registry of children who received 1 palivizumab injection among 32 Canadian sites. Demographic data were collected at enrollment, and respiratory events were documented monthly. Cox proportional hazard analyses were conducted to compare respiratory illness-related hospitalization (RIH) and RSV-related hospitalization (RSVH) among children with NMD and those prophylaxed for standard indications (SI) and complex medical disorders. Results: Group differences were found in enrollment age and weight, birth weight, household crowding, neonatal stay and supplemental oxygen requirement (all P < 0.05). RIH and RSVH incidences were 19.2%, 3.3% (NMD, n = 605); 6.0%, 1.5% (SI, n = 20,335), 9.4%, 1.6% (complex medical disorders, n = 4063), respectively. Children with NMD had a higher risk of RIH (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.90; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.41-2.56; P < 0.0005) than those with SI. RSVH risk was greater in children with NMD compared with both the SI (HR: 2.26; 95% CI: 1.38-3.72; P = 0.001) and complex medical disorders groups (HR: 2.74; 95% CI: 1.55-4.84; P = 0.001). Children with more severe infantile onset NMD had a higher risk of RIH than those with general hypotonic disorders (HR: 1.69; 95% CI: 1.06-2.68; P = 0.027) but not RSVH. Conclusions: Children with NMD who received palivizumab had a higher risk of both RIH and RSVH.

752,"Incidence of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection Among Hospitalized Adults, 2017-2020 Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes acute respiratory illness (ARI) and triggers exacerbations of cardiopulmonary disease. Estimates of incidence in hospitalized adults range widely, with few data on incidence in adults with comorbidities that increase the risk of severity. We conducted a prospective, population-based, surveillance study to estimate incidence of RSV hospitalization among adults overall and those with specific comorbidities. Methods: Hospitalized adults aged 18 years residing in the surveillance area with 2 ARI symptoms or exacerbation of underlying cardiopulmonary disease were screened during the 2017-2018, 2018-2019, and 2019-2020 RSV seasons in 3 hospitals in Rochester, New York and New York City. Respiratory specimens were tested for RSV using polymerase chain reaction assays. RSV incidence per 100 000 was adjusted by market share. Results: Active and passive surveillance identified 1099 adults hospitalized with RSV. Annual incidence during 3 seasons ranged from 44.2 to 58.9/100 000. Age-group-specific incidence ranged from 7.7 to 11.9/100 000, 33.5 to 57.5/100 000, and 136.9 to 255.6/100 000 in patients ages 18-49, 50-64, and 65 years, respectively. Incidence rates in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease, and congestive heart failure were 3-13, 4-7, and 4-33 times, respectively, the incidence in patients without these conditions. Conclusions: We found a high burden of RSV hospitalization in this large prospective study. Notable was the high incidence among older patients and those with cardiac conditions. These data confirm the need for effective vaccines to prevent RSV infection in older and vulnerable adults. (Branche A.R., angela_branche@urmc.rochester.edu; Walsh E.E.; Falsey A.R.)

However, little is known about the extent and maternal effects of RSV infection during pregnancy. We describe 3 cases of maternal RSV infection diagnosed at a US center during winter 2014. Case-patient 1 (26 years old, week 33 of gestation) received a diagnosis of RSV infection and required mechanical ventilation. Case-patient 2 (27 years old, week 34 of gestation) received a diagnosis of infection with influenza A(H1N1) virus and RSV and required mechanical ventilation. Case-patient 3 (21 years old, week 32 of gestation) received a diagnosis of group A streptococcus pharyngitis and RSV infection and was monitored as an outpatient. Clarifying the effects of maternal RSV infection could yield valuable insights into potential maternal and fetal benefits of an effective RSV vaccination program.

This report summarizes the clinical trial information on which the guidance in the accompanying policy statement for administering RSV prophylaxis to certain children with a history of preterm birth, chronic lung disease, or congenital heart disease is based. On the basis of results of a recently completed clinical trial, palivizumab is appropriate for infants and young children with hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease. RSV-IGIV should not be used in children with hemodynamically significant heart disease. Palivizumab is preferred for most high-risk infants and children because of ease of intramuscular administration. Monthly administration of palivizumab during the RSV season results in a 45% to 55% decrease in the rate of hospitalization attributable to RSV. Because of the large number of infants born after 32 to 35 weeks' gestation and because of the high cost, immunoprophylaxis should be considered for this category of preterm infants only if 2 or more risk factors are present.

755,"Respiratory syncytial virus infections in neonates and infants Respiratory syncytial virus is one of the major causes of respiratory tract infections during infancy with high rates of hospitalization and mortality during the first years of life. It is the most common cause of acute bronchiolitis and viral pneumonia in children below two years of age and second the most common cause of postneonatal infant mortality all around the world following malaria. In addition, the virus has been causally linked to recurrent wheezing and associated with pediatric asthma. The respiratory syncytial virus infections tend to be severe in high risk patients such as patients below six months of age, with prematurity, congenital heart diseases, neuromuscular diseases and immune deficiencies. No specific treatment is available for respiratory syncytial virus infections to date. Severe cases require supportive therapy, mainly oxygen supplementation and hydration, and less frequently, ventilatory support. Because there is no vaccine to prevent respiratory syncytial virus infections or clinically effective treatment to administer to children with respiratory syncytial virus infection, immunoprophylaxis with palivizumab is currently the only method for reducing morbidity associated with severe respiratory syncytial virus in high-risk infants.

756,"Acute encephalopathy associated with respiratory syncytial virus infections in childhood: A literature review Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has been described as the single most important virus causing acute respiratory infections, especially bronchiolitis and pneumonia, in children. The most severe infections affect the youngest infants and well-defined high-risk groups, including infants with a history of premature birth, and those with chronic lung disease, congenital heart disease, cystic fibrosis and immunodeficiency. It has been reported that approximately 1/3 of high-risk children hospitalized with RSV infection are admitted to the intensive care unit, while the need for mechanical ventilation and mortality rate are increased in infants with underlying cardiac disease or chronic lung disease. The majority of infants hospitalized for RSV lower respiratory tract infection develop one complication or more, which have an impact on hospital length of stay and costs. A relatively uncommon complication consisting of seizures and other neurologic abnormalities such as lethargy, irritability and abnormal tone has been sporadically reported in infants and children with RSV respiratory infection. A recent study first focused on the association between RSV bronchiolitis and an encephalopathic process occurring in the form of a seizures disorder. This transient neurologic complication seems to be frequently associated with an abnormal EEG pattern, but no anatomic brain damages have been shown. Little is known about the long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of children developing RSV-related encephalopathy, so a prolonged period of neurologic follow up can be recommended.

759,"Risk factors for hospitalization for respiratory syncytial virus infection Background: The aim of this study is to identify the risk factors for hospitalization for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in Danish children. Methods: This is a population-based cohort study with follow-up till 24 months of age. A total of 421,943 Danish children were divided into 5 groups based on gestational age (23-32, 33-35, 36, 37-41 and 42-45 weeks). Results: In adjusted Cox regression models, chronic disease, asthma hospitalization before the RSV infection and siblings were associated with an increased risk of hospitalization for RSV infection in all children independent of gestational age. Plurality was associated with a decreased risk in children born between 23 and 36 weeks of gestation, whereas young maternal age, maternal asthma, single parenthood, maternal smoking, being born small for gestational age, Caesarian section, male gender and day care were associated with an increased risk of hospitalization for RSV infection in term children. In postterm children, young maternal age, male sex, being born small for gestational age and maternal smoking were associated with an increased risk of hospitalization for RSV. Asthma hospitalization before the RSV infection and siblings were associated with the highest measures of increased risk of hospitalization for RSV infection independent of gestational age. Conclusions: By 5 groups of gestational age, we provide estimates of the effects of 12 different factors, which can be regarded as add-on risk factors to those already known to increase the risk of hospitalization for RSV infection. Our study may help clinicians to precisely assess the risk profile in the individual child. (Haerskjold A., Ann.haerskjold@regionh.dk; Graff Stensballe L.)

760,"In-A nd Out-of-hospital Mortality Associated with Seasonal and Pandemic Influenza and Respiratory Syncytial Virus in South Africa, 2009-2013 Estimates of influenza-A nd respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-associated mortality burden are important to guide policy for control. Data are limited on the contribution of out-of-hospital deaths to this mortality. Methods. We modeled excess mortality attributable to influenza and RSV infection by applying regression models to weekly deaths from national vital statistics from 2009 through 2013, using influenza and RSV laboratory surveillance data as covariates. We fitted separate models for in-A nd out-of-hospital deaths. Results. There were 509 791 average annual deaths in South Africa, of which 44% (95% confidence interval [CI] 43%.45%) occurred out-of-hospital. Seasonal influenza and RSV all-cause mortality rates were 23.0 (95% CI 11.0.30.6) and 13.2 (95% CI 6.4.33.8) per 100 000 population annually (2.3% [95%CI 2.3%.2.4%] and 1.3% [95% CI 1.2%.1.4%] of all deaths respectively). The peak mortality rate was in individuals aged .75 years (386.0; 95% CI 176.5.466.3) for influenza and in infants (143.4; 95% CI 0.194.8) for RSV. Overall, 63% (95% CI 62%.-65%) of seasonal influenza and 48% (95% CI 47%.49%) of RSV-associated deaths occurred out-of-hospital. Among children aged >5 years, RSV-associated deaths were more likely to occur in-hospital, whereas influenza-associated deaths were more likely to occur out-of-hospital. The mortality rate was 6.7 (95% CI 6.4.33.8) in the first influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 wave in 2009 and 20.9 (95% CI 6.4.33.8) in the second wave in 2011, with 30% (95% CI 29%.32%) of A(H1N1)pdm09-associated deaths in 2009 occurring out-of-hospital. Discussion. More than 45% of seasonal influenza-A nd RSV-associated deaths occur out-of-hospital in South Africa. These data suggest that hospital-based studies may substantially underestimate mortality burden. (Cohen C., cherylc@nicd.ac.za; Walaza S.; Treurnicht F.K.; Madhi S.A.; McAnerney J.M.)

761,"Severity of viral coinfection in hospitalized infants with respiratory syncytial virus infection Objective: To compare the severity of single respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections with that of coinfections. Methods: A historical cohort was studied, including hospitalized infants with acute RSV infection. Nasopharyngeal aspirate samples were collected from all patients to detect eight respiratory viruses using molecular biology techniques. The following outcomes were analyzed: duration of hospitalization and of oxygen therapy, intensive care unit admission and need of mechanical ventilation. Results were adjusted for confounding factors (prematurity, age and breastfeeding). Results: A hundred and seventy six infants with bronchiolitis and/or pneumonia were included in the study. Their median age was 4.5 months. A hundred and twenty one had single RSV infection and 55 had coinfections (24 RSV + adenovirus, 16 RSV + human metapneumovirus and 15 other less frequent viral associations). The four severity outcomes under study were similar in the group with single RSV infection and in the coinfection groups, independently of what virus was associated with RSV. Conclusion: Virus coinfections do not seem to affect the prognosis of hospitalized infants with acute RSV infection. Copyright  2011 by Sociedade Brasileira de Pediatria. (De Paulis M.)

762,"Recurrent wheezing after respiratory syncytial virus or non-respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis in infancy: A 3-year follow-up Background: Recent studies have suggested that rhinovirus-associated early wheezing is a greater risk factor for development of recurrent wheezing in children than is early wheezing associated with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). We determined the development of recurrent wheezing in young children within 3 years after hospitalization for RSV or non-RSV bronchiolitis. Methods: We identified retrospectively all children <2 years of age who were admitted to Turku University Hospital because of bronchiolitis in the months of August-December during 1988-2001. The primary outcome was recurrent wheezing that required long-term asthma medication. Data on asthma medications of the individual children were derived from the Social Insurance Institution of Finland. Results: Within the first year after hospitalization, 36 of 217 (16.6%) children with non-RSV bronchiolitis developed recurrent wheezing, compared with five of 199 (2.5%) children with RSV bronchiolitis [relative risk (RR) 6.6; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.6-16.5]. The rates of recurrent wheezing were significantly increased in the non-RSV group also within 2 years (RR 2.9; 95% CI 1.7-5.1) and 3 years (RR 3.4; 95% CI 2.0-5.7) after hospitalization. The increased risk of recurrent wheezing in children with non-RSV-associated bronchiolitis was observed both in boys and girls at all time points of the 3-year follow-up, and it was not explained by the age difference between the RSV and non-RSV groups or any confounding seasonal factors. Conclusion: Children hospitalized with bronchiolitis caused by other viruses than RSV develop recurrent wheezing at substantially higher rates during a 3-year follow-up period than do children with RSV-induced bronchiolitis.  2009 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

763,"The Burden of respiratory syncytial virus infection in young children background The primary role of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in causing infant hospitalizations is well recognized, but the total burden of RSV infection among young children remains poorly defined. methods We conducted prospective, population-based surveillance of acute respiratory infections among children under 5 years of age in three U.S. counties. We enrolled hospitalized children from 2000 through 2004 and children presenting as outpatients in emergency departments and pediatric offices from 2002 through 2004. RSV was detected by culture and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Clinical information was obtained from parents and medical records. We calculated population-based rates of hospitalization associated with RSV infection and estimated the rates of RSV-associated outpatient visits. results Among 5067 children enrolled in the study, 919 (18%) had RSV infections. Overall, RSV was associated with 20% of hospitalizations, 18% of emergency department visits, and 15% of office visits for acute respiratory infections from November through April. Average annual hospitalization rates were 17 per 1000 children under 6 months of age and 3 per 1000 children under 5 years of age. Most of the children had no coexisting illnesses. Only prematurity and a young age were independent risk factors for hospitalization. Estimated rates of RSV-associated office visits among children under 5 years of age were three times those in emergency departments. Outpatients had moderately severe RSV-associated illness, but few of the illnesses (3%) were diagnosed as being caused by RSV. conclusions RSV infection is associated with substantial morbidity in U.S. children in both in-patient and outpatient settings. Most children with RSV infection were previously healthy, suggesting that control strategies targeting only high-risk children will have a limited effect on the total disease burden of RSV infection.

764,"Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection Among Hospitalized Infants in Four Middle-Income Countries Background: Understanding respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) global epidemiology is important to inform future prevention strategies. Methods: Hospitalized infants <1-year-old with acute illness were enrolled prospectively in Albania, Jordan, Nicaragua, and Philippines during respiratory seasons in 2015-2017. Medical chart review, parental interview, and post-discharge follow up were conducted. Respiratory specimens were tested using real-time RT-PCR for RSV. Infant characteristics associated with very severe illness (intensive care unit [ICU] admission or receipt of supplemental oxygen) were assessed using logistic regression to adjust for potential confounders (age, sex, study site, and preterm birth). Results: Of 3634 enrolled hospitalized infants, 1129 (31%) tested positive for RSV. The median age of RSV-positive infants was 2.7 (IQR: 1.4-6.1) months and 665 (59%) were male. Very severe illness in 583 (52%) RSV-positive infants was associated with younger age (aOR 4.1, 95% CI: 2.6-6.5 for 0-2 compared to 9-11-months; P <. 01), low weight-for-age z-score (aOR 1.9, 95% CI: 1.2-2.8; P <. 01), ICU care after birth (aOR 1.6, 95% CI: 1.0-2.5; P =. 048), and cesarean delivery (aOR 1.4, 95% CI: 1.0-1.8; P =. 03). RSV subgroups A and B co-circulated at all sites with alternating predominance by year; subgroup was not associated with severity (aOR 1.0, 95% CI: 0.8-1.4). Nine (0.8%) RSV-positive infants died during admission or within 30 days of discharge, of which 7 (78%) were <6-months-old. Conclusions: RSV was associated with nearly a third of infant acute illness hospitalizations in four middle-income countries during the respiratory season, where, in addition to young age, factors including low weight-for-age might be important predictors of severity. RSV prevention strategies targeting young infants could substantially reduce RSV-associated hospitalizations in middle-income countries.

765,"Molecular epidemiology of respiratory syncytial virus transmission in childcare Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important cause of serious respiratory infections in young children. No prior studies using molecular techniques to examine RSV transmission in the community childcare setting have been performed. Objectives: We seek to characterize the molecular epidemiology of RSV transmission in childcare to evaluate the impact of RSV disease in a community-based population. Methods: We sequenced RSV-positive nasopharyngeal samples from a prospective longitudinal study of respiratory illnesses among children enrolled in childcare during three winter seasons. Phylogenetic analysis was performed to identify unique viral strains. Results: RSV was detected in 59 (11%) illnesses. Compared to RSV-negative illnesses, RSV-positive illnesses were associated with longer symptom duration and increased frequency of health care visits. Another respiratory virus was detected in 42 (71%) RSV-positive illnesses. RSV viral load did not differ between RSV-positive illnesses with and without another respiratory virus identified ( P= 0.38). In two childcare rooms, 50% of the children had RSV detected within six days of the first case. Five (38%) of 13 illness episodes from one childcare room were sequenced and shown to be the same viral strain, suggesting rapid child-to-child transmission within the room over a 16 day period. Conclusions: RSV is rapidly transmitted within childcare. Childcare facilities may serve as ideal sites for evaluation of new prevention strategies given the high burden of RSV disease in this population and the rapidity of RSV spread between children.  2013 Elsevier B.V.

766,"Severity and Cost of RSV Hospitalization Among US Preterm Infants Following the 2014 American Academy of Pediatrics Policy Change The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Committee on Infectious Diseases (COID) periodically publishes recommendations for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) immunoprophylaxis (IP) use in pediatric patients considered to be at highest risk for severe RSV infection. In 2014, for the first time, the AAP COID stopped recommending the use of RSV IP for otherwise healthy infants born at 29 weeks gestational age (wGA) or later, stating that RSV hospitalization (RSVH) rates in this population are similar to those of term infants. Subsequently, epidemiological studies in the US at national and regional levels provided evidence of the impact of the policy change in 2934 wGA infants. The results of these studies demonstrated a significant decrease in IP use after 2014 that was associated with an increased rate of RSVH in 2934 wGA infants and an increase in morbidities. RSVH-related morbidities included pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, an increased need for mechanical ventilation, and an increase in the length of stay. After the change in recommendations, the costs of RSVH also rose among 2934 wGA infants. The severity of the illness and expenses associated with RSVH were generally higher among 2934 wGA infants of younger chronologic age compared with older preterm infants. Overall, these studies underscore that 2934 wGA infants continue to be a high-risk pediatric population that could benefit from the protection provided by RSV IP. On the basis of these data, in 2018, the National Perinatal Association developed guidelines that recommended RSV IP for all  32 wGA infants and 3235 wGA infants with additional risk factors. Re-evaluation of the AAP COID policy is warranted in light of these observations.

767,"Current progress on development of respiratory syncytial virus vaccine Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is a major cause of upper and lower respiratory tract illness in infants and young children worldwide. Despite its importance as a respiratory pathogen, there is currently no licensed vaccine for prophylaxis of HRSV infection. There are several hurdles complicating the development of a RSV vaccine: 1) incomplete immunity to natural RSV infection leading to frequent re-infection, 2) immature immune system and maternal antibodies of newborn infants who are the primary subject population, and 3) imbalanced Th2-biased immune responses to certain vaccine candidates leading to exacerbated pulmonary disease. After the failure of an initial trial featuring formalin-inactivated virus as a RSV vaccine, more careful and deliberate efforts have been made towards the development of safe and effective RSV vaccines without vaccine-enhanced disease. A wide array of RSV vaccine strategies is being developed, including live-attenuated viruses, protein subunit-based, and vectorbased candidates. Though licensed vaccines remain to be developed, our great efforts will lead us to reach the goal of attaining safe and effective RSV vaccines in the near future.

768,"Respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis: Disease severity, interleukin-8, and virus genotype In infants with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis, we investigated whether disease severity is associated with the genotype of the infecting virus, or with the infant's immunological response to the infection, as determined by measurement of interleukin-8 mRNA in the nasopharyngeal aspirate. This was a cross-sectional observational study, performed in the Accident and Emergency Department, wards, and Intensive Care Unit of a large pediatric hospital. Participants included 276 infants with respiratory syncytial virus infection. Outcome variables included: disease severity (infants requiring oxygen or ventilation were classified as having severe disease); RSV virus genotype (determined according to typing scheme based on the nucleoprotein and G glycoprotein genes); and amount of interleukin-8 mRNA in the nasopharyngeal aspirate, as measured by a semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction assay. This was corrected for the amount of cellular material in the sample by expressing it relative to mRNA for a constitutively expressed gene, HGPRT. We found a highly significant association between the ratio of interleukin-8 mRN/VHGPRT mRNA in the nasopharyngeal aspirate and the occurrence of severe disease. Odds ratio per unit increase of interleukin-8 mRN/VHGPRT mRNA was 1.15 (95% CI, 1.06, 1.24), P = 0.0004. There was no association between virus genotype and either disease severity or amount of interleukin-8 mRN/VHGPRT mRNA. In conclusion, there is a strong, dose-related association between interleukin-8 mRNA produced locally in the airways and disease severity, and a lack of association with virus genotype. This suggests that clinical manifestations of respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis are determined by local immunological responses to infection, rather than by characteristics of the infecting virus.  2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

769,"Refinement of estimates of mortality risk using the Radiologic Severity Index in hematologic malignancy patients with respiratory syncytial virus infection Background: Immunocompromised hematologic malignancy (HM) patients experience high mortality after respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). We measured radiologic severity to determine whether it could improve the performance of 60-day mortality models based only upon immunodeficiency severity. Methods: We studied 155 HM patients, including 84 hematopoietic cell transplant recipients, who developed RSV LRTI from 2001 to 2013. We measured immunodeficiency using lymphopenia (lymphocyte count <200 cells/mm(3)), Immunodeficiency Severity Index (ISI), and Severe Immunodeficiency (SID) criteria. Radiologic severity was measured by the Radiologic Severity Index (RSI, range 0-72) at time of LRTI (baseline-RSI) and peak severity (peak-RSI). Delta-RSI was defined as the difference between baseline-RSI and peak-RSI. We used logistic regression models to measure the association of immunodeficiency and RSI with 60-day all-cause mortality, and measured model discrimination using areas under the receiver-operating characteristics curves, calibration using Brier scores, and explained variance using pseudo-R(2) values. Results: Forty-one patients died within 60 days of RSV LRTI. Severe immunodeficiency was associated with higher mortality. Peak-RSI (odds ratio [OR] 1.06/point, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.08), and delta-RSI (OR 1.07/point, 95% CI 1.05-1.10) were associated with 60-day mortality after RSV LRTI, but not baseline-RSI. Addition of peak-RSI or delta-RSI to baseline immunodeficiency improved the discrimination, calibration, and explained variance (P < 0.001) of 60-day mortality models. Conclusions: Although baseline immunodeficiency in HM patients helps predict 60-day mortality after RSV LRTI, mortality risk estimates can be further refined by also measuring LRTI progression using RSI. RSI is well-suited as a marker of LRTI severity in RSV infection.

770,"Respiratory syncytial virus persistence: evidence in the mouse model. Several studies have described a clear association between respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract infection in infancy and the subsequent development of persistent wheezing in children. Using the mouse model we demonstrated that RSV induces long-term airway disease characterized by chronic airway inflammation and airway hyperreactivity (AHR). The RSV murine model offers great advantages to study the immunopathogenesis of RSV-induced long-term airway disease. Mice can be challenged with aerosolized methylcholine to determine the presence of AHR. We can apply the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR) to detect RSV RNA in the respiratory tract and we can perform lung gene expression analysis to further characterize the chronic changes induced by RSV infection. Compared with sham-inoculated controls, RSV-infected mice developed chronic airway disease characterized by AHR and persistent airway inflammation. Forty-two days after RSV infection, a time point when RSV could no longer be isolated, RT-PCR demonstrated, quite unexpectedly, the presence of RSV RNA in the lower respiratory tract of mice. The presence of genomic RNA persisted for months after inoculation. Furthermore, preliminary studies also demonstrated that on day 42 there were a number of genes differentially expressed in RSV-infected mice compared with controls. RSV-infected mice with persistent AHR exhibited presence of abnormal chronic inflammatory changes, altered gene expression profiles, and persistence of RSV RNA, which may contribute to long-term airway disease induced by RSV. Future studies are needed to define the significance of persistent RSV RNA in the mouse model, and its potential role in the pathogenesis of RSV-induced persistent wheezing in children.

771,"[Infantile meningitis caused by respiratory syncytial virus]. Respiratory syncytial (RS) virus commonly causes infantile respiratory tract infection causing significant morbidity and mortality, but rarely meningitis. We report a case of meningitis caused by RS virus subgroup B in a 56-day-old boy admitted for high fever who underwent blood examination and lumbar puncture. Empirical chemotherapy was started with intravenous ampicillin, gentamicin, and cefotaxime based on laboratory data on CSF cells (84/microL) and serum CRP (13.8mg/dL) data. RS virus subgroup B was only detected using real-time PCR comprehensive reverse transcription from the first CSF, but no bacterial gene was detected. No bacteria grew from his CSF, urine, or blood. Fever and serum CRP dropped in a few days. He had neither seizures nor disturbance of consciousness and was discharged on day 11 after admission. No evidence of encephalopathy was detected in brain MRI or electroencephalography. RS virus rarely causes meningitis, but a percentage of RS-virus-infected infants exhibit symptoms such as seizure and disturbance of consciousness. We should recognize that the RS virus may cause neurological complications associated with high morbidity and mortality. (Shirota G.) Yokohama Rosai Hospital., (Morozumi M.; Ubukata K.; Shiro H.)"
772,"Respiratory syncytial virus seasonality, Beijing, China, 2007-2015 During July 2007-June 2015, we enrolled 4,225 hospitalized children with pneumonia in a study to determine the seasonality of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in Beijing, China. We defined season as the period during which 10% of total PCRs performed each week were RSV positive. We identified 8 distinctive RSV seasons. On average, the season onset occurred at week 41 (mid-October) and lasted 33 weeks, through week 20 of the next year (mid-May); 97% of all RSV-positive cases occurred during the season. RSV seasons occurred 3-5 weeks earlier and lasted 6 weeks longer in RSV subgroup A-dominant years than in RSV subgroup B-dominant years. Our analysis indicates that monitoring such RSV subgroup shifts might provide better estimates for the onset of RSV transmission. PCR-based tests could be a flexible or complementary way of determining RSV seasonality in locations where RSV surveillance is less well-established, such as local hospitals throughout China.

Prospective studies on RSV prophylaxis in CDH infants are limited. We determined the risk of respiratory illness- and RSV-related hospitalizations (RIH and RSVH, respectively) among infants prophylaxed for CDH, standard indications (SIs) and those without increased risk (NR). Methods: The prospective Canadian Respiratory Syncytial Virus Evaluation Study of Palivizumab (CARESS) registry was searched for infants who received palivizumab during 12 RSV seasons (2005-2017) in Canada. Cox proportional hazards analyses were conducted to compare RIH and RSVH risks across the groups adjusted for potential confounders. Results: In total, 21 107 infants (201 CDH, 389 NR, and 20 517 SI) were included. RIH incidences were 10.0% (CDH), 2.1% (NR), and 6.2% (SI). CDH patients had a significantly higher RIH hazard compared with NR (hazard ratio [HR], 3.6 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.5-8.8]; P =. 005) but not SI (HR, 1.2 [95% CI,. 8-2.0]; P =. 379). RSVH incidences were 0.6%, 0.3%, and 1.5% for CDH, NR, and SI, respectively. RSVH risk was similar across groups (SI: HR, 0.0, P =. 922; NR: HR, 0.0, P =. 934). Conclusions: CDH infants had a 3-fold increased risk of RIH compared to NR but not SI infants. RSVH risk was similar with low RSVH incidences across all groups, implying that CDH infants may benefit from palivizumab during the RSV season, similar to other high-risk groups.

774,"Cost of respiratory syncytial virus-associated acute lower respiratory infection management in young children at the regional and global level: A systematic review and meta-analysis Background. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) in young children aged <5 years. Methods. We aimed to identify the global inpatient and outpatient cost of management of RSV-ALRI in young children to assist health policy makers in making decisions related to resource allocation for interventions to reduce severe morbidity and mortality from RSV in this age group. We searched 3 electronic databases including Global Health, Medline, and EMBASE for studies reporting cost data on RSV management in children under 60 months from 2000 to 2017. Unpublished data on the management cost of RSV episodes were collected through collaboration with an international working group (RSV GEN) and claim databases. Results. We identified 41 studies reporting data from year 1987 to 2017, mainly from Europe, North America, and Australia, covering the management of a total of 365 828 RSV disease episodes. The average cost per episode was 3452 (95% confidence interval [CI], 3265-3639) and 299 (95% CI, 295-303) for inpatient and outpatient management without follow-up, and it increased to 8591(95% CI, 8489-8692) and 2191 (95% CI, 2190-2192), respectively, with follow-up to 2 years after the initial event. Conclusions. Known risk factors (early and late preterm birth, congenital heart disease, chronic lung disease, intensive care unit admission, and ventilator use) were associated with 4160 (95% CI, 3237-5082) increased cost of hospitalization. The global cost of inpatient and outpatient RSV ALRI management in young children in 2017 was estimated to be approximately 4.82 billion (95% CI, 3.47-7.93), 65% of these in developing countries and 55% of global costs accounted for by hospitalization. We have demonstrated that RSV imposed a substantial economic burden on health systems, governments, and the society.

775,"Palivizumab in the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus infection Background. Palivizumab is a monoclonal antibody that has been recently approved in Spain for its use in the passive prophylaxis of severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. Objective. To assess the efficacy, toxicity, and indications of palivizumab in the prevention of RSV infection. Methods. We performed a literature search using Medline databases. The most relevant information is reviewed. Results. The efficacy and toxicity of palivizumab have been evaluated in one placebo-controlled clinical trial. Infants born preterm, or with pulmonary were included inthe study. Prophylaxis with palivizumab during the RSVseason resulted in a reduction of hospitalization as a result of RSV infection from 10.6% to 4.8%. However, the use ofventilatory support, and the mortality rate were not reduced. It was estimated that, in order to prevent the hospital admission of one single infant, palivizumab would have to be administered to 17 risk infants. The most frequently reported adverse events were fever, irritability, and erythema at the injection site. The use of palivizumab is still controversial due to its high cost, and its widespread use is not indicated. Conclusions. Palivizumab is the first product marketed in Spain for RSV prophylaxis. Considering its high cost and the reported efficacy, its indications need to be evaluated very thoroughly. Furthermore, an adequate assessment of the incidence of severs RSV infection and its associated risk factors, as well as the design of a consensuated prospective study are needed.

776,"Respiratory syncytial virus infections in children with cancer Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in children, especially those with cancer. Data on RSV infections in this vulnerable population is limited. We conducted a retrospective study of all RSV infections in children with cancer from 1998 to 2009 to determine characteristics and outcomes of these infections, identify risk factors for LRTI and mortality, and the effect of antiviral therapy on these outcomes. We identified 59 patients with a median age of 5 years; 53% had hematologic malignancy, 32% were hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, 39% had received corticosteroids, and 76% cytotoxic chemotherapy within 1 month before RSV infection. LRTI developed in 22 (37%) patients with a trend of higher rate in males (odds ratio=2.57 [0.86-7.62], P=0.09) and children with lymphocytopenia (odds ratio=2.95 [0.86-10.12], P=0.085). No significant differences were observed in the rates of progression to LRTI (3/10 [30%] vs. 19/49 [39%], P=0.729) and RSV-associated mortality (0/10 [0%] vs. 3/49 [6%], P=0.422) for patients receiving antiviral therapy at upper respiratory tract infection stage compared with those who did not. However, patients with LRTI had significantly better outcomes when treated with aerosolized ribavirin plus immunomodulators (mainly palivizumab) when compared with aerosolized ribavirin alone (mortality rates: 0/6 [0%] vs. 3/4 [75%], P=0.03). Ribavirin did not show any benefit in reducing LRTI or mortality; however, addition of palivizumab to the treatment regimen may be potentially beneficial, especially for children with LRTI.

778,"Respiratory syncytial virus infections requiring hospitalization in patients with primary immunodeficiency Introduction: The aim of the study was to assess the incidence of hospital admission due to severe acute respiratory infection by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV-ARI) in children with primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) and the severity of RSV-ARI in these patients. Methods: We conducted a nationwide cross-sectional retrospective and prospective multicentre study in the 2011-2017 period. The study was performed in 15 Spanish hospitals and included children with PID who required hospital admission due to RSV-ARI. Results: Out of 439 patients with PID followed up at participating hospitals, 13 (3%) required hospital admission due to RSV-ARI. The median age of admitted patients was 1.6 years (interquartile range, 0.5-2.2), and 7 were male. The types of PID most frequently associated with admission due to RSV-ARI were combined immunodeficiency (CID; 4/71 [6%]) and CID with associated or syndromic features (CIDwASF; 6/147 [4%]). Two of the 13 patients were receiving palivizumab for RSV prophylaxis, and 3 received potentially active therapies against RSV during the hospital stay. Viral coinfection was detected in 6 patients, 5 (39%) developed complications, and 4 (31%) required admission to the paediatric intensive care unit. There were no documented RSV-related deaths. Conclusions: In the group of patients with PID, severe RSV infection requiring hospitalization is more frequent in patients with CID and CIDwASF, in whom special efforts should be made to prevent RSV infection. Further studies are needed to confirm these results. (Gonzalez-Granado L.I.)

Existing studies are limited by the number of seasons studied and most have focused on the immunocompromised. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on all adults (18 years) with a positive RSV molecular test admitted from 2009 to 2015 to one hospital in Chicago, IL. Epidemiologic and outcomes data were collected after IRB approval. Results: Of the 489 eligible patients, 227 had RSV A and 262 had RSV B. Patients had a median age of 61 years and comorbidity (eg, chronic lung disease [40.6%], obesity [37.8%], and cardiac disease [34.3%]). On presentation, most had cough (86.5%), fever (42.4%), and shortness of breath (38.2%). Severe disease was present in 27.6% of patients. Antibiotic was used in 76.3% inpatients and 45.8% at discharged despite few patients (4.7%) having documented bacterial infections. Supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation were utilized in 44.6% and 12.3%, respectively, while ICU level care was required in 26.9%. Most patients were discharged home (82.7%). Most deaths (68.4%, 13/19) were attributed to pneumonia or hypoxemia likely from RSV. Most fatal cases were seen in those with recent cancer treatment and older adults. Conclusions: Respiratory syncytial virus in hospitalized adults is associated with significant morbidity and mortality with 26.9% requiring ICU level care.

782,"Respiratory syncytial virus infection in elderly and high-risk adults BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an increasingly recognized cause of illness in adults. Data on the epidemiology and clinical effects in community-dwelling elderly persons and high-risk adults can help in assessing the need for vaccine development. METHODS: During four consecutive winters, we evaluated all respiratory illnesses in prospective cohorts of healthy elderly patients (65 years of age) and high-risk adults (those with chronic heart or lung disease) and in patients hospitalized with acute cardiopulmonary conditions. RSV infection and influenza A were diagnosed on the basis of culture, reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, and serologic studies. RESULTS: A total of 608 healthy elderly patients and 540 high-risk adults were enrolled in prospective surveillance, and 1388 hospitalized patients were enrolled. A total of 2514 illnesses were evaluated. RSV infection was identified in 102 patients in the prospective cohorts and 142 hospitalized patients, and influenza A was diagnosed in 44 patients in the prospective cohorts and 154 hospitalized patients. RSV infection developed annually in 3 to 7 percent of healthy elderly patients and in 4 to 10 percent of high-risk adults. Among healthy elderly patients, RSV infection generated fewer office visits than influenza; however, the use of health care services by high-risk adults was similar in the two groups. In the hospitalized cohort, RSV infection and influenza A resulted in similar lengths of stay, rates of use of intensive care (15 percent and 12 percent, respectively), and mortality (8 percent and 7 percent, respectively). On the basis of the diagnostic codes of the international Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification at discharge, RSV infection accounted for 10.6 percent of hospitalizations for pneumonia, 11.4 percent for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 5.4 percent for congestive heart failure, and 7.2 percent for asthma. CONCLUSIONS: RSV infection is an important illness in elderly and high-risk adults, with a disease burden similar to that of nonpandemic influenza A in a population in which the prevalence of vaccination for influenza is high. An effective RSV vaccine may offer benefits for these adults. Copyright  2005 Massachusetts Medical Society. (Falsey A.R., ann.falsey@viahealth.org; Hennessey P.A.; Formica M.A.; Walsh E.E.)

785,"Surveillance towards preventing paediatric incidence of respiratory syncytial virus attributable respiratory tract infection in primary and secondary/tertiary healthcare settings in Merseyside, Cheshire and Bristol, UK Introduction Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common respiratory virus, particularly affecting children, and can cause respiratory infections such as croup and bronchiolitis. The latter is a leading cause of paediatric hospitalisation within the UK. Children <3 years of age and/or with underlying health conditions are more vulnerable to severe RSV infection. There are currently limited data on the incidence of laboratory-confirmed RSV, particularly within primary care settings and outside the typical  RSV season', which in the Northern hemisphere tends to coincide with winter months. There is also a lack of data on the health economic impact of RSV infection on families and healthcare systems. This observational surveillance study aims to collect data on the incidence of laboratory-confirmed RSV-attributable respiratory tract infection (RTI) in children aged <3 years presenting to primary, secondary or tertiary care; it also aims to estimate the health economic and quality of life impact of RSV-attributable infection in this cohort. Such data will contribute to informing public health strategies to prevent RSV-associated infection, including use of preventative medications. Methods and analysis Parents/carers of children <3 years of age with RTI symptoms will consent for a respiratory sample (nasal swab) to be taken. Laboratory PCR testing will assess for the presence of RSV and/or other pathogens. Data will be obtained from medical records on demographics, comorbidities, severity of infection and hospitalisation outcomes. Parents will complete questionnaires on the impact of ongoing infection symptoms at day 14 and 28 following enrolment. The primary outcome is incidence of laboratory-confirmed RSV in children <3 years presenting to primary, secondary or tertiary care with RTI symptoms leading to health-seeking behaviours. Recruitment will be carried out from December 2021 to March 2023, encompassing two UK winter seasons and intervening months. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been granted (21/WS/0142), and study findings will be published as per International Committee of Medical Journal Editors' guidelines.

786,"CD8 T-cell response to respiratory syncytial virus infection Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection and hospitalization among infants. Despite the significant healthcare burden, there is no licensed RSV vaccine currently available. This problem is further exacerbated as a natural RSV infection fails to elicit the development of long-lived immunity. It is well established that RSV-specific antibodies play a critical role in mediating protection from severe disease. The CD8 T-cell response is critical for mediating virus clearance following an acute RSV infection. However, the relative contribution of memory CD8 T cells in providing protection against secondary RSV infections remains unclear. In addition, data from animal models indicate that memory CD8 T-cell responses can be pathogenic under certain conditions. Herein, we provide an overview of the CD8 T-cell response elicited by RSV infection and how our current knowledge may impact future studies and vaccine development.

787,"Adaptation of a Russian population to SARS-CoV-2: Asymptomatic course, comorbidities, mortality, and other respiratory viruses  A reply to Fear versus Data This study was conducted to assess the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Russia and the adaptation of the population to the virus in March to June 2020. Two groups were investigated: 1) 12 082 individuals already proven positive for SARS-CoV-2 (clinical information was studied); 2) 7864+4458 individuals with suspected respiratory infections (polymerase chain reaction [PCR] tests and clinical information were studied). In the latter, SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals comprised 5.37% in March and 11.42% in June 2020. Several viral co-infections were observed for SARS-CoV-2. Rhinoviruses accounted for the largest proportion of co-infections (7.91% of samples were SARS-CoV-2-positive); followed by respiratory syncytial virus (7.03%); adenoviruses (4.84%); metapneumoviruses (3.29%); parainfluenza viruses (2.42%); enterovirus D68 (1.10%) and other viruses (entero-, echo-, parecho-) (<1%). Average SARS-CoV-2 case fatality rate in the group of 12 537 individuals was determined to be 0.6% (in contrast to official Russian government statistics of 1.5% mortality). This rate is within the range of mortality caused by other common seasonal respiratory viruses (0.01-2.21% in Russia in 2012 to 2020). Most fatalities occurred in individuals with comorbidities, as for other respiratory viruses. The proportion of SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic carriers was 56.68% in March and 70.67% in June 2020. This new pathogen presents a substantial risk to human beings as it was not contained at the start of its outbreak in Wuhan and spread worldwide. However, surveillance, prevention and treatment must be strictly evidence-based and not dictated by fear.

789,"Predicting respiratory syncytial virus hospitalisation in Australian children Background: There is limited information on respiratory syncytial virus infections among Australians, particularly those of Indigenous descent. Aim: This study identifies groups of infants at risk of hospitalisation with respiratory syncytial virus-positive lower respiratory tract infection who may be targeted for prevention with palivizumab. Methods: Case control study: the case notes of 271 children with cases of respiratory syncytial virus-positive lower respiratory tract infection admitted to The Townsville Hospital were studied for risk factors. Controls were chosen randomly from babies born in The Townsville Hospital during that period. Multiple logistic regression analysis and classification and regression tree analysis were used to identify risk factors. Results: Multiple logistic regression analysis identified birthweight <2500 g, maternal parity and marital status to be independent predictors of hospitalisation with respiratory syncytial virus-positive lower respiratory tract infection. Classification and regression tree analysis identified babies born weighing <2500 g who possessed older siblings to be at highest risk. Single mothers and smoking were additional risk factors. Indigenous babies were significantly more likely to be exposed to all of the identified risk factors. Conclusion: Babies born weighing <2500 g (especially with siblings) could be targeted for prevention. All Indigenous babies should be considered at high risk because of their exposure to multiple risk factors.  2006 Paediatrics and Child Health Division (Royal Australasian College of Physicians).

790,"Neutrophil-mediated inflammation in respiratory syncytial viral bronchiolitis Background: The involvement of neutrophil-mediated inflammation may play an important role in the pathogenesis of acute respitory syncytial virus bronchiolitis. However, no measurable marker is sensitive enough to assess neutrophil-mediated inflammation in the airways. Released neutrophil elastase (NE) in intraluminal airways has been reported to induce pulmonary inflammation. The aim of this study was to determine whether the amount of urinary trypsin inhibitor (UTI) in serum, a degenerate induced by NE, reflects the degree of airway inflammation in children with respiratory syncytial viral (RSV) bronchiolitis and whether the severity of inflammation is evaluated. The pre--/inter--trypsin inhibitor is assumed to be precursors of the UTI. When NE degrades these inhibitors, UTI is liberated. Methods: Serum UTI concentrations in infants admitted with RSV bronchiolitis. other viral infections, bacterial pneumonia and control subjects were measured by means of one-step sandwich-type enzyme immunoassay. Results: Serum UTI concentrations in 25 patients on admission were significantly higher than the 15 infantile control values (mean  SEM, 22.126  2.317 and 6.701  0.719 U/mL, respectively; P<0.0001). The elevated levels returned to baseline values with improvement in the respiratory symptoms. Higher levels of serum UTI with RSV infection were consistently associated with clinical symptoms and artificial ventilation. Serum NE concentrations of patients were elevated in some patients but not significantly different from controls in the patients who showed only upper respiratory symptoms with RSV infections. Conclusion: The findings strongly suggested that neutrophil-mediated events are involved in the pathogenesis of RSV bronchiolitis, and the monitoring of UTI concentrations might be useful for evaluating the neutrophil-mediated airway inflammation.

791,"Modelling estimates of the burden of respiratory syncytial virus infection in children in the UK Objective The burden of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) illness is not well characterised in primary care. We estimated the burden of disease attributable to RSV in children in the UK between 1995 and 2009. Design Time-series regression modelling. Setting A multiple linear regression model based on weekly viral surveillance (RSV and influenza, Public Health England), and controlled for non-specific seasonal drivers of disease, estimated the proportion of general practitioner (GP) episodes of care (counted as first visit in a series within 28 days; Clinical Practice Research Datalink, CPRD), hospitalisations (Hospital Episode Statistics, HES) and deaths (Office of National Statistics, ONS) attributable to RSV each season. Participants Children 0-17 years registered with a GP in CPRD, or with a respiratory disease outcome in the HES or ONS databases. Primary outcome measures RSV-attributable burden of GP episodes, hospitalisations and deaths due to respiratory disease by age. RSV-attributable burden associated with selected antibiotic prescriptions. Results RSV-attributable respiratory disease in the UK resulted in an estimated 450 158 GP episodes, 29 160 hospitalisations and 83 deaths per average season in children and adolescents, with the highest proportions in children <6 months of age (14 441/100 000 population, 4184/100 000 and 6/100 000, respectively). In an average season, there were an estimated 125 478 GP episodes for otitis media and 416 133 prescriptions for antibiotics attributable to RSV. More GP episodes, hospitalisations and deaths from respiratory disease were attributable to RSV than to influenza in children under 5 years. Conclusions The burden of RSV in children in the UK exceeds that of influenza. RSV in children and adolescents contributes substantially to GP office visits for a diverse range of illnesses, and was associated with an average 416 133 prescribed antibiotic courses per season. Effective antiviral treatments and preventive vaccines are urgently needed for the management of RSV infection in children. (Taylor S., sylvia.m.taylor@gsk.com; Haguinet F.; Matias G.)

792,"Study on typing of respiratory syncytial viruses OBJECTIVE: To determine the epidemiologic patterns of subgroups A and B and genotypes of respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV) during two uncontinuously epidemic years from 1990 to 1991 and 1997 to 1998 in Beijing. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal secretion (NPS) samples of RSV positive or BSV isolates tested by indirect immunofluorescent (IIF) assay were classified into subgroups A and B. Also, isolates of RSV were divided into at least six different lineages, designated NPl-6, by restriction mapping of the N gene. NP l, 3 and 6 were given by subgroup B isolates, while NP2, 4 and 5 were given by subgroup A isolates. Strains of subgroup A were further subdivided into six lineages SHL 1-6 on the basis of the SH gene sequence. SH lineages were closely related to each other and to NP 1-6. Strains of SHL 1,3, and 4 were closely related and belonged to NP2, SHL 2 and 6 to NP4 and SHL5 to NP5. RESULTS: Of 145 RSV NPS samples from the winter 1997 to the spring 1998, 83(57.2%) were subgroup B strains, 62(42.8%) were sub-group A strains, the rate of occurrence of subgroup A to B strains was about 1:1.3. Two of 10 isolates of 1997-1998 offered by viral department of research institute of Pediatrics were subgroup A strains, whereas 8 were subgroup B strains, the rate of occurrence of subgroup A to B strains was 1:4. Eight subgroup A strains of 10 isolates from the 1990-1991 epidemic were dominant, the proportion of subgroup A to B strains was 4:1. of 10 BSV isolates in 1997-1998, all 2 subgroups A strains gave N gene fragment restriction pattern NP4, and fell into SH lineage SHL2, whereas 8 subgroup B strains all belonged to NP3. All 8 subgroup A isolates from the 1990-1991 epidemic gave pattern NP4, and fell into SHL2, while 2 subgroups B strains all belonged to NP3. The classification of subgroups A and B deduced from NP patterns was corresponded to the definition of these subgroups by monoclonal antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: These observations confirmed that subgroups A and B or multiple lineages of BSV co-circulated in Beijing, but different genomic types predominated each year. Moreover, very similar viruses were isolated up to more than 5 years ago, indicating that despite apparent diversity of the subgroup A strains, the separate lineages might be relatively stable.

793,"Impact of a bronchiolitis guideline on ED resource use and cost: A segmented time-series analysis OBJECTIVE: Bronchiolitis is a major cause of infant morbidity and contributes to millions of dollars in health care costs. Care guidelines may cut costs by reducing unnecessary resource utilization. Through the implementation of a guideline, we sought to reduce unnecessary resource utilization and improve the value of care provided to infants with bronchiolitis in a pediatric emergency department (ED). METHODS: We conducted an interrupted time series that examined ED visits of 2929 patients with bronchiolitis, aged 1 to 12 months old, seen between November 2007 and April 2013. Outcomes were proportion having a chest radiograph (CXR), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) testing, albuterol or antibiotic administration, and the total cost of care. Balancing measures included admission rate, returns to the ED resulting in admission within 72 hours of discharge, and ED length of stay (LOS). RESULTS: There were no significant preexisting trends in the outcomes. After guideline implementation, there was an absolute reduction of 23% in CXR (95% confidence interval [CI]: 11% to 34%), 11% in RSV testing (95% CI: 6% to 17%), 7% in albuterol use (95% CI: 0.2% to 13%), and 41 minutes in ED LOS (95% CI: 16 to 65 minutes). Mean cost per patient was reduced by $197 (95% CI: $136 to $259). Total cost savings was $196 409 (95% CI: $135 592 to $258 223) over the 2 bronchiolitis seasons after guideline implementation. There were no significant differences in antibiotic use, admission rates, or returns resulting in admission within 72 hours of discharge. CONCLUSIONS: A bronchiolitis guideline was associated with reductions in CXR, RSV testing, albuterol use, ED LOS, and total costs in a pediatric ED.

795,"Respiratory syncytial virus hospitalization in middle-aged and older adults Background The importance of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is increasingly recognized in hospitalized adults, but mainly in those  65 years. Objectives We sought to describe the epidemiology and clinical severity of RSV compared to influenza in hospitalized adults 18 years. Study design Adults hospitalized with acute respiratory illnesses (ARI) of 10 days duration were prospectively enrolled from two Michigan hospitals during two influenza seasons. Collected specimens were tested for RSV and influenza by real-time, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Viral load and subtype were determined for RSV-positive specimens. We evaluated factors associated with RSV and outcomes of infection using multivariable logistic regression. RSV-positive patients were separately compared to two reference groups: RSV-negative and influenza-negative, and influenza-positive patients. Results RSV was detected in 84 (7%) of 1259 hospitalized individuals (55 RSV-B, 29 RSV-A). The highest prevalence was found in 5064 year olds (40/460; 8.7%); 98% of RSV cases in this age group had at least one chronic comorbidity. RSV detection was associated with obesity (OR: 1.71 95% CI: 0.99-3.06, p = 0.03). Individuals with RSV were admitted to the hospital later in their illness and had a higher median Charlson comborbidity index (3 vs 2 p < 0.001) compared to those with influenza. Clinical severity of RSV-associated hospitalizations was similar to influenza-associated hospitalizations. Discussion In this study we observed the highest frequency of RSV-associated hospitalizations among adult 5064 years old; many of whom had chronic comorbidities. Our results suggest the potential benefit of including these individuals in future RSV vaccination strategies.

Materials and methods. Medical records of children who were born before a gestational age of 32 weeks in the years 1995 - 2000 and who subsequently developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Results. Ten children among 44 candidates for prophylactic treatment were hospitalised. Three children tested positively for respiratory syncytial virus. On the basis of international studies, we estimate that two hospitalisations at a costs of approx. NOK 850 000 each might have been prevented. Interpretation.

797,"Immunoglobulin treatment for hospitalised infants and young children with respiratory syncytial virus infection Background: Millions of children are hospitalised due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection every year. Treatment is supportive, and current therapies (e.g. inhaled bronchodilators, epinephrine, nebulised hypertonic saline, and corticosteroids) are ineffective or have limited effect. Respiratory syncytial virus immunoglobulin may be used prophylactically to prevent hospital admission from RSV-related illness. It may be considered for the treatment of established severe RSV infection or for treatment in an immunocompromised host, although it is not licensed for this purpose. It is unclear whether immunoglobulins improve outcomes when used as a treatment for established RSV infection in infants and young children admitted to hospital. This is an update of a review first published in 2019. Objectives: To assess the effects of immunoglobulins for the treatment of RSV-proven lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in children aged up to three years, admitted to hospital. Search methods: For this 2022 update, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Specialised Register, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Web of Science (from inception to 2 December 2022) with no restrictions. We searched two trial registries for ongoing trials (to 2 December 2022) and checked the reference lists of reviews and included articles for additional studies. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials comparing immunoglobulins with placebo in hospitalised infants and children aged up to three years with laboratory-diagnosed RSV lower respiratory tract infection. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. We assessed evidence certainty using GRADE. Main results: In total, we included eight trials involving 906 infants and children aged up to three years. We included one new trial in this update. The immunoglobulin preparations used in these trials included anti-RSV immunoglobulin and the monoclonal antibody preparations palivizumab and motavizumab. Five trials were conducted at single or multiple sites within a single high-income country (four in the USA, one in Qatar). Three trials included study sites in different countries. All three of these trials included study sites in one or more high-income countries (USA, Chile, New Zealand, Australia, Qatar), with two trials also including a study site in a middle-income country (Panama). Five of the eight trials were ""supported"" or ""sponsored"" by the trial drug manufacturers. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of immunoglobulins on mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14 to 5.27; 4 studies, 309 participants). There were four deaths - two amongst 98 children receiving immunoglobulins, and two amongst 98 children receiving placebo. One additional death occurred in a fourth trial, however the study group of the child was not known and the data were not included in the analysis (very low-certainty evidence). The use of immunoglobulins in infants and children admitted to hospital with RSV proven LRTI probably results in little to no difference in the length of hospitalisation (mean difference (MD) 0.13 days, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.12; 6 studies, 737 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Immunoglobulins may result in little to no difference in the number of children who experience one or more adverse events of any severity or seriousness compared to placebo (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.78; 5 studies, 340 participants; low-certainty evidence) or the number of children who experience one or more adverse events judged by study investigators to be serious in nature, compared to placebo (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.79; 4 studies, 238 participants; low-certainty evidence). Certainty of evidence for secondary outcomes was low. This evidence suggests that use of immunoglobulins results in little to no difference in the need for, or duration of, mechanical ventilation and the need for, or duration of, supplemental oxygen. The use of immunoglobulins does not reduce the need for admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and when children are admitted to the ICU results in little to no difference in the duration of ICU stay. Authors' conclusions: We are very uncertain about the effect of immunoglobulins on mortality. We are moderately certain that use of immunoglobulins in hospitalised infants and children may result in little to no difference in the length of hospitalisation. Immunoglobulins may result in little to no difference in adverse events, the need for or duration of mechanical ventilation, supplemental oxygen, or admission to the intensive care unit, though we are less certain about this evidence and the true effect of immunoglobulins on these outcomes may differ markedly from the estimated effect observed in this review. All trials were conducted in high-income countries, and data from populations in which the rate of death from RSV infection is higher are lacking.

798,"Nosocomial respiratory syncytial virus infections: The ""cold war"" has not ended Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major nosocomial hazard on pediatric wards during its annual outbreaks. It produces significant morbidity in young children and is most severe in those with underlying conditions, especially cardiopulmonary and immunosuppressive diseases. In older patients, RSV may exacerbate an underlying condition or pulmonary and cardiac manifestations. On transplant units, of RSV may be occult and is associated with high mortality rates. The manifestations of nosocomial RSV infections may be atypical, especially in neonates and immunosuppressed patients, resulting in delayed or missed diagnosis and adding appreciably to the costs of hospitalization. RSV is primarily spread by close contact with infectious secretions, either by large-particle aerosols or by fomites and subsequent self-inoculation, and medical staff are often instrumental in its transmission. Thus, integral to any infection control program is the education of personnel about the modes of transmission, the manifestations, and the importance of RSV nosocomial infections. Hand washing is probably the most important infection control procedure. The choice of barrier controls should be decided by individual institutions depending on the patients, the type of ward, and the benefit relative to cost. (Hall C.B.)

799,"Pertussis vaccination and the risk of respiratory syncytial virus-associated hospitalization Background: Animal data suggest an association between recent vaccination with a pertussis-containing vaccine and increased severity of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. We sought to determine whether such an association exists in humans by studying a population-based cohort of young children. Patients and Methods: We performed a nested case-control study of 280 children younger than 24 months of age hospitalized with RSV infection in Olmsted County, MN from January 1990 to December 1999. Controls (2 per case) consisted of nonhospitalized residents of Olmsted County matched to cases by date of birth and sex. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for the odds of hospitalization for RSV infection among subjects with a recent pertussis-containing vaccination in proximity to the cases' date of hospitalization relative to the odds among subjects with no vaccination. Results: The OR for receipt of a pertussis-containing vaccine within 0 to 6 days of a case's hospitalization for RSV disease was 0.8 (95% CI 0.4-1.8). For the time intervals 7-13, 14-20 and 21 days, the OR were 1.3 (95% CI 0.5-3.0), 1.3 (95% CI 0.5-3.2) and 0.7 (95% CI 0.3-1.5), respectively. Adjusting for vaccine delay and for risk status did not alter the findings. The median interval between the most recent pertussis-containing vaccine and the case's date of hospitalization was 40 days for cases and 42.5 days for controls (P = 0.69). Among the RSV cases, pertussis vaccination in the month preceding hospitalization was not a risk factor for oxygen requirement (P = 0.82), intensive care unit admission (P = 0.46) or need for mechanical ventilation (P = 0.28). Conclusion: In our study, recent immunization with a pertussis-containing vaccine was not a risk factor for hospitalization for RSV infection. In addition, among children hospitalized with RSV infection, recent pertussis immunization was not associated with a more severe clinical course. Copyright  2004 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

800,"Clinical and epidemiologic features of respiratory syncytial virus Since its discovery in 1955, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has consistently been noted to be the single most important cause of lower respiratory tract illness in infants <1 year of age. RSV also causes repeat infections and significant disease throughout life. In addition to the young child, persons with compromised immune, pulmonary or cardiac systems, and the elderly have significant risk from infection. Though RSV causes the full spectrum of acute respiratory illnesses, it is most notably associated with signs and symptoms of increased airway resistance manifested as wheezing and, in the young child, diagnosed as bronchiolitis. In temperate climates, RSV occurs as yearly outbreaks usually between late fall and early spring lasting 3-4 months in a community. The timing of outbreaks varies between years and in the same year between regions and even between nearby communities. RSV can be a serious nosocomial pathogen in high risk individuals but nosocomial transmission that can often be prevented with meticulous attention to good infection control practices. High risk groups include the premature infants and persons of any age with compromised cardiac, pulmonary, or immune systems. Risk factors for infection include increased number of children in the household and day care center attendance. There are reasonable estimates of the sizable burden of RSV disease in infants and young children and the elderly but less data on disease in older children, the role of RSV in later reactive airway disease (see chapter by M.T. Lotz et al., this volume), and RSV-associated mortality in developing countries. The available data on burden of disease suggests there are at least four potential target populations for a vaccine, the young infant, young children >4-6 months of age, pregnant women, and the elderly. A link between infection in the young infant and later reactive airway disease and mortality in developing countries is needed. Each target population has different vaccine safety and efficacy concerns and may warrant a different type of vaccine.  Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013. (Hall C.B.)

802,"Hospitalizations for Respiratory Syncytial Virus and Vaccine Preventable Infections following Pediatric Heart Transplantation Objective: To determine the risk factors for acquiring a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and vaccine-preventable infections (R/VPI) in pediatric heart transplant recipients and the associated morbidity and hospital resource use. Study design: Patients <18 years who underwent heart transplantation from September 2003 to December 2018 at hospitals using the Pediatric Health Information System database were identified. Their transplant hospitalization and subsequent hospitalizations for R/VPI through December 2018 were analyzed. Risk factors for R/VPI hospitalizations were evaluated using negative regression binomial models adjusted for demographic and clinical confounders. Total hospital costs were adjusted for 2018 US$. Results: Of 3815 transplant recipients, 681 (17.9%) had an R/VPI hospitalization during 23 746 available person-years of follow-up. There were 984 R/VPIs diagnosed during 951 hospitalizations, and 440 (44.7%) occurred the first year after transplantation. The most common causes were RSV (n = 380; 38.6%), influenza (n = 265; 26.9%), and pneumococcus (n = 105; 10.7%). In adjusted analyses, there was an increased risk of R/VPI hospitalization in patients requiring mechanical circulatory support before transplantation, patients receiving induction with 2 immunosuppressive agents, and patients <2 years in the first year after transplantation. The median length of stay for an R/VPI hospitalization was 4 days (IQR, 2-8 days) with a median total cost of $11 081 (IQR, $6215-$24 322). Conclusions: Hospitalization for R/VPIs occurred frequently after heart transplantation and were associated with significant costs. Potential strategies to minimize R/VPI include expanding vaccine use through accelerated immunization schedules, further studies of use of palivizumab beyond 2 years of age, and immunogenicity monitoring after vaccination with re-immunization based on guidelines.

803,"A multi-center study to determine genetic variations in the fusion gene of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) from children <2 years of age in the U.S. The fusion (F) protein of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the major target of immunoprophylactic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and vaccines. Recently reported mutations in F gene antigenic sites can vary among RSV types A and B. To further understand mutations in RSV F proteins, we performed subtyping and F gene sequencing on 400 RSV-positive respiratory samples collected at four pediatric hospitals within the United States from children under 2 years old between 2018 and 2020. RSV B was predominant in 20182019 and RSV A in 20192020 (55.5% and 85.5% respectively). Compared to the reference sequence, all RSV B samples had at least one antigenic polymorphism with the most changes at sites AM14/V (100%) and  (93.3%) followed by II (5.8%), IV (3.9%), and p27 (2.9%). The most frequent mutations among RSV B for AM14/V site were in L172Q (100%), S173L (100%), and K191R (95.2%) while for  site they were in I206M (93.3%) and Q209R (93.3%). Conversely, polymorphisms were observed in only 15.3% of RSV A samples overall, specifically at antigenic sites p27 (5.9%), IV (3.0%), II (2.5%), AM14/V (2.0%), I (2.0%), and  (0.5%). Among RSV A cases, T122A at p27 (n = 10) and S276N at II (n = 3) were the most common substitution sites. S276N at site II was found in both RSV types. Although polymorphisms in F proteins of RSV B were more common than those in RSV A samples, changes in both subtypes were observed in key F antigenic sites which could potentially impact the efficacy of mAb therapies and vaccines.

804,"Severe Clinical Outcomes Among Adults Hospitalized With Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections, New York City, 2017-2019 Objectives: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes substantial morbidity and mortality in older adults. We assessed severe clinical outcomes among hospitalized adults that were associated with RSV infections. Methods: We performed a nested retrospective study in 3 New York City hospitals during 2 respiratory viral seasons, October 2017April 2018 and October 2018April 2019, to determine the proportion of patients with laboratory-confirmed RSV infection who experienced severe outcomes defined as intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, and/or death. We assessed factors associated with these severe outcomes and explored the effect of RSV-associated hospitalizations on changes in the living situations of surviving patients. Results: Of the 403 patients studied (median age, 69 years), 119 (29.5%) were aged 80. Severe outcomes occurred in 19.1% of patients, including ICU admissions (16.4%), mechanical ventilation (12.4%), and/or death (6.7%). Patients admitted from residential living facilities had a 4.43 times higher likelihood of severe RSV infection compared with patients who were living in the community with or without assistance from family or home health aides. At discharge, 56 (15.1%) patients required a higher level of care than at admission. Conclusions: RSV infection was associated with severe outcomes in adults. Living in a residential facility at admission was a risk factor for severe outcomes and could be a proxy for frailty rather than an independent risk factor. Our data support the development of prevention strategies for RSV infection in older populations, especially older adults living in residential living facilities.

805,"Recent advances in the management and prophylaxis of respiratory syncytial virus infection Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is an important cause of morbidity, particularly in prematurely born infants who have had chronic lung disease. Current therapy is essentially supportive. Overall, the results of randomized trials do not support the use of bronchodilators, corticosteroids or Ribavirin. Nitric oxide and exogenous surfactant may improve the respiratory status of those infants who require ventilatory support. Nosocomial infection can be reduced by appropriate handwashing. There is no safe and effective vaccine for use in infants. Immunoprophylaxis reduces hospitalization and requirement for intensive care. Palivizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, is preferred to RSV immune globulin as the immunoprophylactic agent. Immunoprophylaxis should be reserved for infants at highest risk of severe respiratory syncytial virus infection, if this strategy is to be used most cost-effectively. (Greenough A.)

806,"Hospitalization for respiratory syncytial virus in the paediatric population in Spain The aim of this population-based retrospective study was to determine the incidence of hospitalization for community-acquired, laboratory-confirmed respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in an unselected paediatric population from southern Europe. The study was performed in an area with 15 700 children aged less than 5 years attended by a single hospital. The presence of RSV in nasopharyngeal aspirates from children with acute respiratory infection treated in the hospital was investigated in four seasons (July 1996-June 2000). A total of 390 episodes of hospitalization for RSV infection were detected and 83.3 % of the children were aged less than 1 year old. The annual hospitalization rate was 37/1000 for infants aged less than 6 months and 25/1000 for those aged less than 1 year. During the study period, 2.5 % of the infants younger than 1 year and approximately 5 % of those younger than 3 months were hospitalized for RSV infection. The mean length of hospital stay was 5.9 days. Seven per cent of the patients required admission to the intensive care unit and more than half of these children were aged less than 1 month. In Spain, community-acquired RSV infection is a highly frequent cause of hospitalization in young children, especially in those aged less than 1 year. Prevention of RSV infection, through the development of vaccines and/or other strategies, should be a public health priority. (Vicente D.; Montes M.; Cilla G.; Perez-Trallero E.)

807,"Brief report: respiratory syncytial virus activity--United States, 2004-2005. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) (e.g., bronchiolitis and pneumonia) among young children, resulting in an estimated 51,000-82,000 hospitalizations annually in the United States. RSV also causes severe disease and death among older persons and persons of all ages with compromised respiratory, cardiac, or immune systems and can exacerbate chronic cardiac and pulmonary conditions. In temperate climates, most RSV infections occur during a distinct seasonal peak. This report presents preliminary data from RSV activity reported to the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) for the weeks ending July 2 through December 3, 2005, indicating the onset of the 2005-06 RSV season, and summarizes trends during July 2004-June 2005. Health-care providers should consider RSV in the differential diagnosis for persons of all ages with LRTIs, implement appropriate isolation precautions to prevent nosocomial transmission, and provide appropriate immune prophylaxis to eligible children, including certain premature infants or infants and children with chronic lung and heart disease.

808,"Respiratory syncytial virus infections in children in general practice Introduction: The aim of the study was to describe the course of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections in children under two years of age seen in general practice. Material and methods: Children under two years of age presenting acute respiratory infection during the registration period on 59 GPs' lists participated in the study. The GPs recorded data on a registration chart and a questionnaire was sent to the parents of the children in question one month after the date of inclusion. The children were tested in general practice for the presence of RSV. The GPs' objective findings and choice of treatment as well as the parents' account of the course of disease were compared in children with and without the presence of RSV. A total of 221 children participated in the study. Results: Fiftyseven children were found RSV positive (25.8%). Among the RSV positive children there were significantly more with wheezing audibly detected with examination by stethoscope than among the RSV negative. The remaining parameters (the GP's objective examination, treatment and course of the disease) were distributed independently of the result of the RSV analysis. Discussion: The results showed that RSV infections in children under two years in general practice are frequent and that the clinical picture most often is uncomplicated. (Nielsen L.M.) Lgehuset, E.

809,"Antibiotics prescription in infants hospitalized with respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia INTRODUCTION: Although not useful, antibiotics are commonly prescribed in infants with viral pneumonia. OBJECTIVE: To compare initial prescription and suspension rates of antibiotics in infants hospitalized with pneumonia by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in 2002, when introducing the viral testing, and in 2007, after 5 years of this practice. POPULATION AND METHODS: Children aged under 13 months hospitalized for RSV pneumonia during two years (2002 and 2007) were included. Prescription and discontinuation of antibiotics were registered. Data were analyzed using Chi squared and T tests, assuming p <0.05 as significance level. RESULTS: Antibiotics were prescribed in 57% (40/70) of patients in 2002 and 46% of then (29/63) in 2007. After achieving RSV diagnosis, antibiotics were more frequently discontinued in 2007 than in 2002 (31/63 vs. 14/70; p= 0.012; OR: 3.73; IC 95%:1.1512.49). CONCLUSION: Although antibiotic empirical prescription rate was similar in both periods, after achieving RSV diagnosis antibiotics were more frequently discontinued in 2007.

810,"Patient equity and respiratory syncytial virus Immunoprophylaxis An analysis of benefit and cost is critical for independent advisory groups that provide evidence-based recommendations. In many countries, the role of RSV immunoprophylaxis for infants at increased risk of hospitalization is controversial because of limited benefit and high cost. The report by Ginsberg and co-workers provides evidence, that in Israel, despite the potential benefit of palivizumab prophylaxis in reducing a small number of RSV hospitalizations but no evidence of long-term benefit, the cost is difficult to justify. Ideally, a safe and effective RSV vaccine or more effective and less expensive monoclonal antibody soon will become available.

811,"Current state and challenges in developing respiratory syncytial virus vaccines Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the main cause of acute respiratory tract infections in infants and it also induces significant disease in the elderly. The clinical course may be severe, especially in high-risk populations (infants and elderly), with a large number of deaths in developing countries and of intensive care hospitalizations worldwide. To date, prevention strategies against RSV infection is based on hygienic measures and passive immunization with humanized monoclonal antibodies, limited to selected high-risk children due to their high costs. The development of a safe and effective vaccine is a global health need and an important objective of research in this field. A growing number of RSV vaccine candidates in different formats (particle-based vaccines, vector-based vaccines, subunit vaccines and live-attenuated vaccines) are being developed and are now at different stages, many of them already being in the clinical stage. While waiting for commercially available safe and effective vaccines, immune prophylaxis in selected groups of high-risk populations is still mandatory.

Bronchiolitis hospitalizations declined among US infants from 2000 2009; however, rates in infants at high risk for RSV have not been described. This study examined RSV and unspecified bronchiolitis (UB) hospitalization rates from 1997 2012 among US high-risk infants. Methods: The Kids' Inpatient Database (KID) infant annual RSV (ICD-9 079.6,466.11, 480.1) and UB (ICD-9 466.19, 466.1) hospitalization rates were estimated using weighted counts. Denominators were based on birth hospitalizations with conditions associated with high-risk for RSV: chronic perinatal respiratory disease (chronic lung disease [CLD]); congenital airway anomalies (CAA); congenital heart disease (CHD); Down syndrome (DS); and other genetic, metabolic, musculoskeletal, and immunodeficiency conditions. Preterm infants could not be identified. Hospitalizations were characterized by mechanical ventilation, inpatient mortality, length of stay, and total cost (2015$). Poisson and linear regression were used to test statistical significance of trends. Results: RSV and UB hospitalization rates were substantially elevated for infants with higher-risk CHD, CLD, CAA and DS without CHD compared with all infants. RSV rates declined by 47.0% in CLD and 49.7% in higher-risk CHD infants; no other declines in high-risk groups were observed. UB rates increased in all high-risk groups except for a 22.5% decrease among higher-risk CHD. Among high-risk infants, mechanical ventilation increased through 2012 to 20.4% and 13.5% of RSV and UB hospitalizations; geometric mean cost increased to $31,742 and $25,962, respectively, and RSV mortality declined to 0.9%. Conclusions: Among high-risk infants between 1997 and 2012, RSV hospitalization rates declined among CLD and higher-risk CHD infants, coincident with widespread RSV immunoprophylaxis use in these populations. UB hospitalization rates increased in all high-risk groups except higher-risk CHD, suggesting improvement in the health status of higher-risk CHD infants, potentially due to enhanced surgical interventions. Mechanical ventilation use and RSV and UB hospitalization costs increased while RSV mortality declined. Copyright: (Doucette A.; Jiang X.; Fryzek J.; Coalson J.)

This investigation was conducted to understand the details of hospitalized patients infected with RSV in Nagano. Methods: The study used a questionnaire to survey hospitals who treated children for RSV infection in the pediatric wards of 11 major hospitals in Nagano. Results: Between April 2016 and March 2017, 438 patients were hospitalized with RSV infection in the 11 participating hospitals. The mean gestational age at birth was 38 weeks 2 days. Average birthweight was 2,834 g. The ratio of hospitalized patients with RSV infection to the total number of hospitalized patients was, on average, 7.0% in the second-level hospitals. Despite the use of prophylactic palivizumab, six patients were hospitalized. Conclusions: The rate of hospitalization for RSV was similar across each of the second-level hospitals in Nagano. Patients hospitalized after prophylactic palivizumab had received palivizumab only a few times during the season when infection rates were highest. Palivizumab is therefore advised prior to the outbreak initiation season. (Yanagisawa T.)

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) (e.g., bronchiolitis and pneumonia) among young children in the United States. RSV also causes severe respiratory disease and a substantial number of deaths among older adults and persons with compromised respiratory, cardiac, or immune systems.

817,"Relative frequency, Possible Risk Factors, Viral Codetection Rates, and Seasonality of Respiratory Syncytial Virus among Children with Lower Respiratory Tract Infection in Northeastern Brazil Few studies, each limited to a single major city, have investigated the prevalence and seasonal patterns of different viruses among children with low respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in Northeastern Brazil. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and of 7 other viruses in children for LRTI in 4 capitals from this region, and investigate their association with several risk factors, including meteorological data. From April 2012 to March 2013, 507 children, aged up to 24 months and hospitalized with LRTI in one of the participating centers at Aracaju, Salvador, Recife, and Maceio, had a sample of nasopharyngeal aspirate collected and analyzed for the following viruses by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction followed by hybridization on low-density microarrays: RSV, influenza, parainfluenza, adenovirus, rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, bocavirus, and coronavirus. The result was positive in 66.5% of cases, RSV was the most common virus (40.2%). Except for rhinovirus (17%), all other virus had frequency rates lower than 6%. Viral coinfections were detected in 13.8% of samples. Possible related risk factors for RSV infection were low age upon entry, attendance of daycare, low gestational age, and low educational level of the father. The relative frequency of viral infections was associated with increasing temperature and decreasing humidity separately, but the results also suggested both associated with increased frequency of RSV. Some of these findings differ from those reported for other regions in Brazil and may be used to guide policies that address LRTI.

818,"High seroprevalence of antibodies against human respiratory syncytial virus and evidence of respiratory syncytial virus reinfection in young children in Thailand Objectives: To investigate the seroprevalence of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections in young children, the correlation between RSV antibody levels in maternal and cord serum, and to provide evidence of RSV reinfection in Thai children after primary infections. Methods: Serum samples were collected from 302 mothers and 291 children between 2015 and 2021. Maternal and cord blood were collected at birth. Serial serum samples of children were collected at the ages of 2, 7, 18, 19, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months and the presence of anti-RSV immunoglobulin G (IgG) was tested using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: The cord: maternal serum antibody ratio was 1.09 (95% confidence interval 1.08-1.11). Although >90% of babies at birth were seropositive through transplacental transfer, antibody levels gradually declined, with the highest seronegative rate (91.9%) at 7 months of age. Subsequently, anti-RSV IgG levels increased with age, most likely due to natural infection. One-third of the children showed evidence of reinfection as determined by seroconversion of anti-RSV IgG or increased titers of at least 50 relative units/ml. Conclusion: Waning of RSV antibodies in infants is rapid, and RSV infection subsequently increases anti-RSV IgG titers. RSV vaccination in children before the age of 7 months should be recommended.

819,"Prophylaxis of respiratory syncytial virus in Canada in 2003 Passive immunization of high-risk children with the humanized monoclonal antibody palivizumab is the mainstay of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) prophylaxis in Canada in 2003. This product appears to be safe, and it prevents the majority of RSV hospitalizations in infants born before 36 weeks gestational age, and about half in children under 24 months of age with hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease. However, the high cost of palivizumab and the fact that at least 12 infants need to be treated throughout RSV season to prevent one hospitalization make it difficult to determine the ideal indications for the product. Because these high-risk infants account for a minority of RSV hospitalizations, it is desirable to search for a prophylactic strategy that is practical to apply in all infants.

820,"Respiratory syncytial virus--United States, July 2012-June 2014 Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes lower respiratory infection among infants and young children worldwide. Annually in the United States, RSV infection has been associated with an estimated 57,527 hospitalizations and 2.1 million outpatient visits among children aged <5 years. In temperate climate zones, RSV generally circulates during the fall, winter, and spring. However, the exact timing and duration of RSV seasons vary by region and from year-to-year. Knowing the start of the RSV season in any given locality is important to health care providers and public health officials who use RSV seasonality data to guide diagnostic testing and the timing of RSV immunoprophylaxis for children at high risk for severe respiratory infection. To describe RSV seasonality (defined as onset, offset, peak, and duration) nationally, by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) regions and for the state of Florida, CDC analyzes RSV laboratory detections reported to the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS). Florida is reported separately because it has an earlier season onset and longer season duration than the rest of the country. For 2012-13, the RSV season onset ranged from late October to late December, and season offset ranged from late December to late April, excluding Florida. For 2013-14, the RSV season onset ranged from late October to late January, and season offset from late January to early April, excluding Florida.

822,"Nosocomial Infections in Patients Hospitalized with Respiratory Syncytial Virus: A Practice Review Viral testing is not always recommended in children with bronchiolitis due to doubts concerning its prognostic use. In this retrospective study, we investigated how the RSV testing would influence the frequency of nosocomial infections (NI). The files of 305 children, hospitalized due to the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in the period 20102014, were reviewed in the study. We found ten cases of NI. The RSV preventive measures did not vary in the consecutive years investigated, but the number of viral tests substantially varied. In 2010, 2012, and 2014, when ca. 2 tests per RSV(+) patient were performed, the risk of NI per patient was 1.3%, while in 2011 and 2013, when the RSV testing was less frequent, the accumulated risk per patient was 5.2%. There was a strong adverse relationship between the number of tests performed and the number of NI (rho = 0.975). The children with NI, when compared to those without NI, required a longer hospital stay, generating higher hospital costs regarding treatment, productivity loss, and indirect costs. The expenditure for RSV testing in the years of a low NI risk was higher than that in the high-risk years. Conversely, the expenditure related to NI management was lower in the years of a low NI risk. Each euro spent on RSV testing saved over 26  from the NI management expenditure. We conclude that RSV testing is needed in the hospital setting to isolate the infected children and to prevent nosocomial RSV spread. This strategy is health advantageous and requires less resources than NI treatment.

823,"Respiratory syncytial virus outbreak in a veterans affairs long-term care facility Background Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is increasingly becoming an important cause of respiratory infections in adults, especially those living in long-term care facilities (LTCFs). Seasonal outbreaks peaking from October to April are common. We report an outbreak of RSV involving 2 LTCFs with total capacity of 80 beds in 2019. Methods Retrospective chart review of cases identified with positive RSV infection via DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from January 24 to February 24, 2019, at 2 LTCF units, in close proximity to each other, at Northport Affairs Medical Center. Results Twenty veterans (18 men and 2 women) tested positive for RSV by rapid PCR. The median age was 73 (47-89) years, 85% are Caucasian, and 5 patients had temperature of greater than 100F (100F-102.4F). All had rhinorrhea and 65% had cough. Medical history shows 45% with dementia, 30% with stroke, and 35% with diabetes; 2 patients on hemodialysis; and 2 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Four patients required hospitalization, and 2 of them required admission to intensive care unit. Length of stay ranged from 1 to 9 days. One patient with COPD required mechanical ventilation. One patient with computed tomography finding of airway impaction had antibiotics stopped by infectious diseases consult, yet he developed Clostridium difficile diarrhea. No deaths were observed, and all patients recovered. Aggressive infection control measures were implemented. Conclusions Respiratory syncytial virus is highly infectious and can easily cause an outbreak in an LTCF. Polymerase chain reaction testing was contributory to identify cases rapidly. Rapid PCR results and intensified infection control measures were instrumental to halt the outbreak. (Barrett N.; Bailey L.; Ford F.; Thorne M.)

824,"Nirsevimab: Towards universal child immunization against respiratory syncytial virus Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes epidemic acute respiratory pathologies especially in young children and the elderly. There is currently no effective vaccine against this virus. An alternative to prevent RSV disease is passive immunoprophylaxis through the administration of neutralizing antibodies. In 2002, palivizumab was approved for children at risk of RSV. However, its high cost and its monthly administration do not allow it to be used as universal prophylaxis. In 2017, the monoclonal antibody nirsevimab, which has a power and activity 50 times higher than palivizumab, was described as having a half-life of at least 5 months. Clinical trials have shown the efficacy and safety of nirsevimab in preventing both the disease and hospital admissions associated with RSV in premature and full-term infants, both healthy and with previous cardiopulmonary pathologies. With this monoclonal antibody, universal immunization is feasible (vaccine-like strategy). (Reina J., jorge.reina@ssib.es; Iglesias C.)

825,"Respiratory syncytial virus infection in infants in rural Nepal Objectives Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) pneumonia is a leading cause of infant mortality worldwide. The risk of RSV infection associated with preterm birth is not well-characterized in resource-limited settings. We aimed to obtain precise estimates of risk factors and disease burden of RSV in infants in rural southern Nepal. Methods Pregnant women were enrolled, and along with their infants, followed to six months after birth with active weekly home-based surveillance for acute respiratory illness (ARI). Mid-nasal swabs were obtained and tested for RSV by PCR for all illness episodes. Birth outcomes were assessed at a postpartum home visit. Results 311 (9%) of 3509 infants had an RSV ARI. RSV ARI incidence decreased from 551/1000 person-years in infants born between 28 and 31 weeks to 195/1000 person-years in infants born full-term (p = 0.017). Of 220 infants (71%) evaluated in the health system, 41 (19%) visited a hospital or physician. Of 287 infants with an assessment performed, 203 (71%) had a lower respiratory tract infection. Conclusions In a rural south Asian setting with intensive home-based surveillance, RSV caused a significant burden of respiratory illness. Preterm infants had the highest incidence of RSV ARI, and should be considered a priority group for RSV preventive interventions in resource-limited settings.

827,"Cost-efficacy analysis of palivizumab in the prevention of Respiratory Syncytial Virus infections in young children with hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease Aims. This paper aimed to model costs and outcome of prophylaxis with palivizumab in children with congenital heart disease compared with no prophylaxis, from a third payer perspective. Patients and Methods. A decision-analytic approach was used to model the two alternatives. Estimates of the effectiveness in reducing Respiratory Syncitial Virus (RSV)-induced respiratory diseases and consequent morbidity and mortality in the first year of observation were obtained from a multicenter, randomised, placebo-controlled trial comparing palivizumab with no prophylaxis; estimates of survival expectance were obtained by the literature. Only resources used to make the prophylaxis or treat RSV-induced respiratory infections were considered; costs were calculated considering national tariffs and the cost of the drug to hospitals. Results. Children who underwent prophylaxis had an average life expectancy (LE) of 51.3 years compared to 50.8 of children who did not undergo prophylaxis. Costs were 3.990 for prophylaxis and 596 for no prophylaxis. The incremental cost per life-year gained for prophylaxis is 7.186. Sensitivity analyses showed that cost per life-year gained is most sensitive to discount rate applied to survival, but remains below 23.000 even applying a 5% discount rate. Discussion. The decision model suggests that palivizumab prophylaxis is cost-effective, from a National Health Service perspective, in children with a congenital heart disease. (Chiroli S.)

829,"[Research on the methods for titrating respiratory syncytial virus]. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of lower respiratory infection in infants. It is very important to quantitative assay of RSV titer in the study on RSV pathogenesis, candidate vaccine and antiviral treatment. Therefore, we develop Real-time Quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) assay and enzyme immunospots (EIS) for titrating RSV and compare them with traditional 50% tissue culture infectious doses (TCID50). Q-PCR, based upon the RSV-L genes, and EIS were utilized to titrate samples from RSV culture supernatants and RSV infected mouse lungs. Then, the results were compared with TCID50. For the samples from RSV culture supernatants, the ratio of Q-PCR and EIS (plaque forming unit, pfu) was 10:1 and the ratio of EIS and TCID50 was 10:1 when TCID50 was converted as pfu. For the samples from RSV infected mouse lungs, the ratio of Q-PCR and EIS was 1000:1 and the ratio of EIS and TCID50 was 5:1. We have successfully established Q-PCR and EIS to titrate RSV and compared them with TCID50. We concluded EIS is a cost-effective method to titrate RSV. (Wang X.B.)

830,"Respiratory syncytial virus infection in children hospitalised with acute lower respiratory tract infection Background. Data are lacking on respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) respiratory tract infections in children from developing countries. Objective. To determine the importance of RSV as a cause of acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRTI) in Cape Town children. Methods. Children younger than 2 years of age admitted to hospital with ALRTI over a 15-month period from 1 June 1995 to 31 August 1996 were studied prospectively. Sociodemographic data, risk factors for severe RSV disease clinical signs, diagnosis and hospital course were documented. A nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) for detection of RSV by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) was obtained in all cases. The NPA of every fifth child was sent for viral culture. Results. A total of 1288 patients (60% male, 40% female) with a median age (25th-75th percentile) of 6 months (2-11 months) was enrolled; 32.4 had one or more risk factors for severe RSV infection. Pneumonia was diagnosed in 62.2%, bronchiolitis in 20.6%, laryngotracheobronchitis (LTB) in 8% and other respiratory illnesses in 9.2%. Mild disease, requiring admission to an overnight ward, was documented in 38.1%, while 48.9% and 13% respectively had moderate and severe disease requiring admission to a general ward and intensive care unit (ICU). Supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation were required by 68.9% and 8.5% of patients, respectively. The median duration of hospital stay was 5 days (range 1-10 days). RSV EIA was positive in 16.4% of cases, arid there was no difference in detection rates according to diagnosis. Viral culture performed in 162 of the 1288 study patients (12.6%) grew RSV in 11.7% of cases, adenovirus in 3.7%, para-influenza virus type 3 in 2.5% and influenza B virus in 0.6%. Patients who tested RSV EIA-positive did not significantly differ from those who tested negative with regard to demographic variables, clinical diagnoses, risk factors for RSV or length of hospitalisation. The only significant difference noted was the presence of hyperinflation, which occurred in 70.1% of EIA-positive patients compared with 57.1% of those testing negative (P = 0.0005). The mortality rate (2%) was similar for both groups. Conclusion. This study indicates that RSV is an important cause of hospitalisation in infants and young children with ALRTI. Distinguishing RSV from other ALRTIs is difficult because of similarity in clinical presentation among children. (Hussey G.D.; Apolles P.; Arendse Z.; Robertson A.; Swingler G.; Zar H.J.)

831,"Prevalence of Bandemia in Respiratory Viral Infections: A Pediatric Emergency Room Experience Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of bandemia in confirmed respiratory viral infections in febrile infants and children presenting to the emergency department. Methods: An observational retrospective study from January 1, 2016, through December 31, 2016, was conducted in patients between the ages of  1 month and  5 years presenting to the emergency room with fever and who had a complete blood cell count performed. Patients were separated into seven groups based on the type of respiratory viral infection. Inclusion criteria strictly counted children with viral infections and absence of clinical and laboratory evidence of a bacterial coinfection. Results: A total of 419 patients had a documented viral infection. A significant proportion of these children were found to have bandemia; children with adenovirus (17%), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (14.9%), human metapneumovirus (hMPV) (13%), and parainfluenza virus (7.9%) had the highest prevalence when the cutoff for bandemia was set at 10%. The prevalence increased to 35.3, 30.9, 40.3, and 15.8% for adenovirus, RSV, hMPV, and parainfluenza virus, respectively, when this cutoff was lowered further to 5%.

832,"Mortality Associated With Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Bronchiolitis, and Influenza Among Infants in the United States: A Birth Cohort Study From 1999 to 2018 Background: Infant mortality due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in the United States is not well understood. Methods: From 1999 to 2018, RSV, bronchiolitis, and influenza deaths were described for infants <1 year using linked birth/death datasets from the National Vital Statistics System. Mortality was described overall and by infant birth and death characteristics. Bronchiolitis was included as the plausible upper limit of RSV, while influenza served as a comparator. Results: Total infant deaths were 561 RSV, 1603 bronchiolitis, and 504 influenza, and rates were 6.9 (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.4-7.5), 19.8 (95% CI, 18.9-20.8), and 6.2 (95% CI, 5.7-6.8) per 1 000 000 live births, respectively. The highest RSV rates were observed among <29 weeks' gestational age infants (103.5; 95% CI, 81.8-129.1), American Indian/Alaskan Native (20.3; 95% CI, 11.6-33.0), and Medicaid-insured (7.3; 95% CI, 5.9-8.9). However, RSV mortality burden was greatest in full-term (53.7%), white (44.9%), and Medicaid-insured (61.7%) infants. Deaths outside the inpatient setting were 21% and 54% for RSV and bronchiolitis; more Medicaid- (58%) and other/unknown-insured (69%) infants with bronchiolitis died outside of the inpatient setting, compared to privately insured infants (48%) (P =. 0327).

Study design: Retrospective cohort study of all children <3 years old enrolled in the Tennessee Medicaid program from July 1989 through June 1993 (248,652 child-years). Results: During the first year of life, the estimated number of RSV hospitalizations per 1000 children was 388 for those with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, 92 for those with congenital heart disease, 70 for children born at 28 weeks' gestation, 66 for those born at 29 to <33 weeks, 57 for those born at 33 to <56 weeks, and 30 for children born at term with no underlying medical condition. In the second year of life, children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia had an estimated 73 RSV hospitalizations per 1000 children, whereas those with congenital heart disease had 18 and those with prematurity 16 per 1000. Overall, 53% of RSV hospitalizations occurred in healthy children born at term. Conclusions: Children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia have high rates of RSV hospitalization until 24 months of age.

834,"Chest radiological patterns predict the duration of mechanical ventilation in children with RSV infection Background: RSV-infected children demonstrate various radiographic features, some of which are associated with worse clinical outcomes. Objective: To investigate whether specific chest radiological patterns in RSV-infected children with acute respiratory failure (ARF) in the peri-intubation period are associated with prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation. Materials and methods: We included RSV-infected children <1 year of age admitted with ARF from 1996 through 2002 to the pediatric intensive care unit at Massachusetts General Hospital. Their chest radiographs were evaluated at three time-points: preintubation (day -1) and days 1 and 2 after intubation. Univariate and multiple logistic regressions models were utilized to investigate our objective. Results: The study included 46 children. Using day 1 chest radiograph findings to predict duration of mechanical ventilation of >8 days, a backward stepwise regression arrived at a model that included age and right and left lung atelectasis. Using day 2 chest radiograph results, the best model included age and left lung atelectasis. A model combining the two days' findings yielded an area under the ROC curve of 0.92 with a satisfactory fit (P=0.95). Conclusion: Chest radiological patterns around the time of intubation can identify children with RSV-associated ARF who would require prolonged mechanical ventilation.  2008 Springer-Verlag.

835,"Review and Update of Active and Passive Immunization Against Respiratory Syncytial Virus Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in children, causing approximately 3.6 million hospitalizations per year, and has been associated with long-term pulmonary sequelae for up to 30 years after infection, yet preventative strategies and active treatment options remain elusive. The associated morbidity and healthcare related costs could be decreased substantially with the development of these much-needed medications. After an initial false start in the development of an RSV vaccine, gradual progress is now being made with the development of multiple vaccine candidates using numerous different mechanisms of action. Furthermore, nirsevimab, a new monoclonal antibody for the prevention of RSV, has recently been registered in the European Union. New novel treatments for RSV infection are also in the pipeline, which would provide the clinician with much needed ammunition in the management of the acute disease. The next few years have the potential to change the landscape of LRTI forever through the prevention and management of RSV LRTI and thereby decrease the mortality and morbidity associated with it. In this review, we discuss these new approaches, current research, and clinical trials in monoclonal antibody and vaccine development against RSV.

836,"Febrile status epilepticus due to respiratory syncytial virus infection Background: Febrile status epilepticus can have neurological sequelae. The type of sequelae, however, depend on the etiology, including infection due to viral agents such as the influenza virus. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in childhood may also contribute to this. The aim of this study was therefore to characterize febrile status epilepticus associated with RSV infection, and to determine whether this type of infection is a risk factor for neurological sequelae in febrile status epilepticus. Methods: We reviewed the medical records of children aged 3 years with febrile status epilepticus who were admitted to a tertiary hospital between January 2007 and December 2011. The differences between the RSV-positive and RSV-negative groups were evaluated according to the demographic and clinical data. Results: A total of 99 patients with febrile status epilepticus who had been tested for RSV infection were identified. Three patients in the RSV-positive group (n = 19) and four in the RSV-negative group (n = 80) presented with bronchiolitis. The incidence of intubation and anti-seizure drug treatment in the RSV-positive group was significantly higher than in the -negative group. While all of the patients in the RSV-negative group recovered completely, six patients in the RSV-positive group developed encephalopathy and profound neurological sequelae. In five of the six patients, diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging showed subcortical white matter lesions. Conclusions: RSV infection in the absence of bronchiolitis can initially present as febrile status epilepticus and subsequently develop into acute encephalopathy with profound neurological sequelae.

837,"Time course of severe respiratory syncytial virus infection in mechanically ventilated infants The time course of intensive care for severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract illness may be predicted by the severity of gas exchange during the first 48 h of mechanical ventilation. To test this hypothesis, two studies were undertaken in RSV-positive mechanically ventilated patients who did not have chronic lung disease, congenital heart disease or immunodeficiency. First, a retrospective criteria-generating review of 45 infants was carried out. In these infants, more severe lower airway disease, as demonstrated by four-quadrant consolidation on chest X-ray, was associated with 'best' alveolar arterial oxygen gradients (AaDO(2), torr) and mean airway pressure (MAP, cm H(2)O) values as follows: first 24h, AaDO(2) >400 and MAP> 10 (positive and negative predictive values 100% and 97%, respectively); second 24 h, AaDO(2)  300 and MAP > 10 (positive and negative predictive values 91% and 100%, respectively). The second study, a prospective, hypothesis-testing, analysis of length-of-stay in 44 infants stratified according to the above AaDO(2) and MAP criteria demonstrated that the duration of intensive care was longer in the severe group: median (interquartile range in days) 17 (15-39) vs 7 (4-8) (p < 0.01). We suggest that, in mechanically ventilated infants with RSV, the time course of intensive care is predictable based on early clinical features and respiratory parameters. Therefore reports on the effectiveness of special therapies using intensive care stay as a measure of outcome should be interpreted with respect to these observations before drawing conclusions about efficacy.

838,"Nosocomial respiratory syncytial virus infections in children's wards During community outbreak, nosocomial infections caused by both groups (A and B) of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) occur as the most common nosocomial infections at pediatric wards. RSV cross-infection is considered to have taken place when a child acquires an infection after being in the ward longer than 7 days, and its frequency at the ward could be calculated in several ways. That frequency ranges worldwide between 30% and 70% in neonatal units, and between 20% and 40% at pediatric wards. The infections are manifested as lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in 20-60% and 30-40% of cases, respectively. These infections could be early diagnosed by an RSV rapid detection method. In RSV-positive children who develop LRTI and belong to the category with a high risk of developing severe RSV disease, a specific therapy is recommended. The frequency of RSV nosocomial infections at children's wards could be considerably reduced (to only a few per cent) by providing education to hospital personnel in the etiology and transmission of respiratory viruses and by compliance with pediatric droplet precautions (cohort nursing, and gown and glove wearing/handwashing in any contact with infected children).

839,"Drugs for the management of respiratory syncytial virus infection. The management of infants hospitalized with respiratory syncytial virus infection is essentially supportive. Drug therapy can have benefits, but these may only be short-term. Systematic review of randomized trials has demonstrated that bronchodilator administration only significantly improves clinical scores. Neither corticosteroids nor ribavirin influence the course of the acute illness, and whether they reduce the associated chronic respiratory morbidity remains controversial. Preliminary results suggest that surfactant, DNase and nitric oxide may be efficacious. Immunoglobulins have no role in the management of acute RSV infection, but passive prophylaxis reduces the hospital admission rate. (Broughton S.; Greenough A.)

840,"Hospitalizations due to respiratory syncytial virus outside of the typical season Objective: Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is the most common cause of bronchiolitis and viral lower respiratory tract infections in children. It is associated with annual winter epidemics across the United States, typically October through April. Our objective is to describe the clinical characteristics of children hospitalized outside the typical RSV season and to compare them with those admitted during the season. Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted of all patients who were hospitalized at Children's Hospital of Austin from May 2000 to September 2006 and had a positive RSV antigen test. Descriptive statistics, tests of differences, and associations between patients diagnosed in the off-season versus typical season were conducted. Results: A total of 850 charts of RSV-positive cases were reviewed. Of these, 45 patients (5.3%) were admitted during the off-season. The following variables were statistically significantly associated with diagnosis in the off-season versus typical season: mean birth weight (2704 g vs. 3204 g respectively, p=0.0001); gestational age at birth less than 36 weeks (OR=4.35; 95% CI: 2.2, 8.6); history of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission at birth (OR=6.04; 95% CI: 2.9, 12.5); and multiple birth (OR=3.38; 95% CI: 1.2, 9.2). Conclusions: Infants with RSV infection outside of the typical season were more likely to have been premature, of lower birth weight, the products of multiple births, and admitted to the NICU at birth.  2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

841,"Effect of altitude on hospitalizations for respiratory syncytial virus infection OBJECTIVE. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is the foremost cause of serious lower respiratory tract infection in young children and infants. Because higher rates of hospitalization for bronchiolitis and pneumonia have been noted in high-altitude regions, we hypothesized that physiologic responses to altitude would predispose children to more severe illness from RSV infection. This study examined the effect of residential altitude on hospitalizations for RSV infection in Colorado from 1998 through 2002. METHODS. A geographic information system was used to assemble data for altitude and demographic variables by zip code-tabulation areas. Data then were linked with hospital discharge data for RSV infections. Poisson regression models were developed to explore correlations between hospitalization rates and residential altitude, after adjustment for socioeconomic differences in the underlying population. RESULTS. RSV-associated hospitalizations averaged 15.9 per 1000 infants who were younger than 1 year and 1.8 per 1000 children who were 1 to 4 years of age per season. A multivariate analysis suggested that the rate of hospitalization for RSV-specific International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes increased 25% among infants who were younger than 1 year and 53% among children who were 1 to 4 years of age for every 1000-m increase in altitude. The risk for RSV-associated hospitalization was highest at elevations above 2500 m. CONCLUSIONS. High altitude above 2500 m is a modest predictor for RSV-associated hospitalization. Practitioners in these regions should consider additional efforts to educate parents about RSV infection and its prevention and the importance of early treatment.

842,"Respiratory syncytial virusassociated hospitalizations among young children: 20152016 BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of hospitalized acute respiratory illness (ARI) among young children. With RSV vaccines and immunoprophylaxis agents in clinical development, we sought to update estimates of US pediatric RSV hospitalization burden. METHODS: Children,5 years old hospitalized for ARI were enrolled through active, prospective, population-based surveillance from November 1, 2015, to June 30, 2016, at 7 US pediatric hospital sites. Clinical information was obtained from parent interviews and medical records. Midturbinate nasal and throat flocked swabs were collected and tested for RSV by using molecular diagnostic assays at each site. We conducted descriptive analyses and calculated population-based rates of RSV-associated hospitalizations. RESULTS: Among 2969 hospitalized children included in analyses, 1043 (35%) tested RSV-positive; 903 (87%) children who were RSV-positive were,2 years old, and 526 (50%) were,6 months old. RSV-associated hospitalization rates were 2.9 per 1000 children,5 years old and 14.7 per 1000 children,6 months old; the highest age-specific rate was observed in 1-month-old infants (25.1 per 1000). Most children who were infected with RSV (67%) had no underlying comorbid conditions and no history of preterm birth. CONCLUSIONS: During the 20152016 season, RSV infection was associated with one-third of ARI hospitalizations in our study population of young children. Hospitalization rates were highest in infants,6 months. Most children who were RSV-positive had no history of prematurity or underlying medical conditions, suggesting that all young children could benefit from targeted interventions against RSV.

843,"Machine learning early prediction of respiratory syncytial virus in pediatric hospitalized patients Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes millions of infections among children in the US each year and can cause severe disease or death. Infections that are not promptly detected can cause outbreaks that put other hospitalized patients at risk. No tools besides diagnostic testing are available to rapidly and reliably predict RSV infections among hospitalized patients. We conducted a retrospective study from pediatric electronic health record (EHR) data and built a machine learning model to predict whether a patient will test positive to RSV by nucleic acid amplification test during their stay. Our model demonstrated excellent discrimination with an area under the receiver-operating curve of 0.919, a sensitivity of 0.802, and specificity of 0.876. Our model can help clinicians identify patients who may have RSV infections rapidly and cost-effectively. Successfully integrating this model into routine pediatric inpatient care may assist efforts in patient care and infection control.

844,"Relationship between respiratory syncytial virus subtype and clinical severity in bronchiolitis Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most frequently implicated agent in bronchiolitis. The virus presents two antigenic subtypes (A and B). The results of studies on the relationship between viral subtype and clinical severity are conflicting. Purpose: To evaluate whether the subtype of this virus constitutes an independent variable in the severity of clinical expression of RSV infection. Patients and methods: We prospectively studied previously healthy children aged less than 2 years admitted for RSV infection during an epidemic season. Clinical presentation and evolution, laboratory and radiological aspects were compared in subsets of children infected with RSV subtype A or B. Clinical severity parameters included score and duration of respiratory distress, oxygen requirements, admission to the intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation and length of hospital stay. Results: Eighty-five patients were enrolled in the study (50 boys and 35 girls; mean age 4.8  4,3 months). Fifty-nine chil dren were infected with RSV subtype A. No differences were found in age, sex or antecedents but children with subtype B were less likely to have been breast-fed. Clinical presentation and laboratory and radiological findings were similar in both groups. No statistically significant differences in clinical severity parameters were found between subsets A and B. Age less than 3 months was associated with greater duration of respiratory distress and longer hospital stay. Conclusion: The results do not support the hypothesis that subtype A infection is associated with more severe respiratory syncytial virus disease.

845,"Respiratory syncytial virus immunoprophylaxis in high-risk infants with heart disease Aim: Passive immunisation with palivizumab is recommended in many countries for children with haemodynamically significant cardiac disease. We trialled respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) immunoprophylaxis in such infants during 2008-2009. Methods: We identified all RSV admissions between 2005-2009 and examined all patients with significant cardiac disease who received palivizumab in 2008-2009. Results: Infants with symptomatic cardiac disease had a more complicated course of RSV bronchiolitis with longer hospital stay, more frequent intensive care admission, longer intensive care stay and were more likely to receive respiratory support (all P < 0.05). One hundred seventeen infants with symptomatic cardiac disease received palivizumab. Of these, two (1.7%) required admission for RSV bronchiolitis. Overall, there was a reduction in admission of infants with symptomatic cardiac disease with RSV bronchiolitis in 2008-2009 (2% per year) compared with 2005-2007 (5-9% per year; P < 0.03). The number of patients with symptomatic cardiac disease who required intensive care for RSV bronchiolitis in the same period was unchanged, as a number presented to our service with RSV infection prior to commencing immunoprophylaxis or having had their cardiac diagnosis made in other centres. Conclusions: Compared with other infants, those with haemodynamically significant cardiac disease have a more complicated course of illness with RSV bronchiolitis. In these infants, palivizumab reduced the number of hospitalisations because of RSV. Cohorting patients for maximal palivizumab use reduced overall cost. To significantly impact on intensive care admissions overall, immunoprophylaxis should be considered at a regional level.  2011 Paediatrics and Child Health Division (Royal Australasian College of Physicians).

Whether subgroup-specific variations in disease severity result from differences in RSV load has not been studied. A total of 102 RSV-hospitalized infants <2 y of age were studied. Nasal washes were collected in a standardized manner and were cultured in <3 h in parallel with an RSV quantitative standard in a HEp-2 plaque assay. RSV-A (72%) was more frequent than RSV-B.

848,"New drugs and treatment for respiratory syncytial virus The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a global health problem affecting infants and the elderly and claiming more lives than AIDS in many parts of the world. Only two antibody drugs are approved for its prevention, and ribavarin, a relatively nonspecific antiviral, is used for treatment. In the mid-1990s, a number of pharmaceutical and biotech companies initiated research programs against RSV. Together, the academic and the industrial R&D covered the whole spectrum of antibodies, vaccines, synthetic small molecule antiviral and antisense technology, and at one point, accounted for at least 25 active R&D programs. However, coincident to the marketing of the monoclonal antibody palivizumab (Synagis) in 1998, a sharp decline in such projects ensued. Many companies recently cancelled RSV projects during a prioritisation of their R&D portfolios although the continuing medical need, large market size and sales projections clearly indicate that a safe and effective RSV drug or vaccine is likely to attain blockbuster status. Today RSV receives an insignificant fraction of the R&D budget compared with AIDS, for example. This article reviews the present status of the anti-RSV regimen, covers drugs in the market and in development, and attempts to link basic research to industrial drug development, animal models of RSV, clinical trials, current clinical management, and present and future market projections. It is hoped that the unmet medical need of the victims of RSV will encourage continued involvement of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry in developing safe and effective prevention and treatments for RSV.

849,"Respiratory syncytial virus infections from 1994 to 1999 Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common cause of acute respiratory infections in infants and young children. The most severe clinical manifestations (in the form of bronchiolitis) are reported in children aged up to 6 months. At the Virology Department, Croatian National Institute of Public Health, nasopharyngeal secretions obtained from 1,232 patients hospitalized in two Zagreb hospitals for acute respiratory infections were tested. The virus was detected by isolating it in a cell culture and/or by detecting it with monoclonal antibodies in the direct immunofluorescence assay. Most often, the virus demonstrated was RSV (43.8%; 540/1232). Other respiratory viruses (adeno, parainfluenza, influenza) were shown considerably less commonly (5.1%). Viral infection could not be demonstrated in 629 (51.1%) patients. RSV was demonstrated to be the most common cause of bronchiolitis (60.77%; 251/413). It was also proven to be the most common causative agent of infections in children aged 0-6 months (55.6%; 300/540). Bronchiolitis (63%; 190/300) and, less commonly, pneumonia (9.7%; 29/300) were the diagnoses linked with RSV in this age group. RSV was demonstrated in 21% (63/300) of the children diagnosed with upper respiratory tract infection. We showed the presence of the majority of RSV infections in the winter months, i.e. between November and March.

850,"Estimated Cardiorespiratory Hospitalizations Attributable to Influenza and Respiratory Syncytial Virus among Long-term Care Facility Residents Importance: Older adults residing in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) are at a high risk of being infected with respiratory viruses, such as influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Although these infections commonly have many cardiorespiratory sequelae, the national burden of influenza- and RSV-attributable cardiorespiratory events remains unknown for the multimorbid and vulnerable LTCF population. Objective: To estimate the incidence of cardiorespiratory hospitalizations that were attributable to influenza and RSV among LTCF residents and to quantify the economic burden of these hospitalizations on the US health care system by estimating their associated cost and length of stay. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study used national Medicare Provider Analysis and Review inpatient claims and Minimum Data Set clinical assessments for 6 respiratory seasons (2011-2017). Long-stay residents of LTCFs were identified as those living in the facility for at least 100 days (index date), aged 65 years or older, and with 6 months of continuous enrollment in Medicare Part A were included. Follow-up occurred from the resident's index date until the first hospitalization, discharge from the LTCF, disenrollment from Medicare, death, or the end of the study. Residents could re-enter the sample; thus, long-stay episodes of care were identified. Data analysis was performed between January 1 and September 30, 2020. Exposures: Seasonal circulating pandemic 2009 influenza A(H1N1), human influenza A(H3N2), influenza B, and RSV. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cardiorespiratory hospitalizations (eg, asthma exacerbation, heart failure) were identified using primary diagnosis codes. Influenza- and RSV-attributable cardiorespiratory events were estimated using a negative binomial regression model adjusted for weekly circulating influenza and RSV testing data. Length of stay and costs of influenza- and RSV-attributable events were then estimated. Results: The study population comprised 2909106 LTCF residents with 3138962 long-stay episodes and 5079872 person-years of follow-up. Overall, 10939 (95% CI, 9413-12 464) influenza- and RSV-attributable cardiorespiratory events occurred, with an incidence of 215 (95% CI, 185-245) events per 100000 person-years. The cost of influenza- and RSV-attributable cardiorespiratory events was $91055393 (95% CI, $77885316-$104225470), and the length of stay was 56858 (95% CI, 48757-64 968) days. Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that many cardiorespiratory hospitalizations among LTCF residents in the US were attributable to seasonal influenza and RSV. To minimize the burden these events place on the health care system and residents of LTCFs and to prevent virus transmission, additional preventive measures should be implemented..

851,"Hospitalization for respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis and disease severity in twins Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common cause of lower respiratory tract disease and hospitalization in infants and young children. Infants of multiple births, who are often premature, might be more susceptible to developing a more severe RSV infection than singletons. objective: To assess the impact of multiple births on the severity of RSV infection and define risk factors for acquiring RSV infection in infants of multiple birth. Methods: Clinical data on infants hospitalized with RSV infection between 2008 and 2010 were retrospectively collected. results: Twins comprised 7.6% (66/875) of hospitalized infants with RSV bronchiolitis during the study period. Infants in the twin group were younger (122.4  131.7 vs. 204.5  278.8 days, P = 0.014), had a lower mean gestational age (35.3  2.6 vs. 38.6  2.5 weeks, P < 0.001), and were more likely to have been born prematurely compared with singleton infants (65.6% vs. 13%, P < 0.001). On a multivariable logistic regression analysis, young age, early gestational age and male gender were the only variables identified as risk factors for pediatric intensive care unit admission (P < 0.001, P < 0.001 and P = 0.03, respectively). In contrast, the mere fact of a child being a twin was not found to be a significant risk factor for disease severity. In addition, if one twin is hospitalized due to RSV infection, the other has a 34% chance of also being hospitalized with bronchiolitis. Young age was a significant risk factor for hospitalization of the second twin (P < 0.001). conclusions: Our findings suggest that twins hospitalized with RSV bronchiolitis do not have an increased risk for severe infection as compared to singletons. However, a twin of an infant hospitalized with RSV infection has a considerable risk of also being hospitalized with bronchiolitis, thus close monitoring is recommended.

Premature infants with birthweight < or = 1,000 g had the highest hospitalisation rates, the longest hospital stay and most complications. However, surprisingly many complications occurred among previously healthy infants. INTERPRETATION: Recommendations for RSV prophylaxis among preterm infants should be investigated in a larger study. Development of an RSV vaccine should be a priority. (Fjaerli H.O.; Farstad T.; Tjade T.) Barneavdelingen, Sentralsykehuset i Akershus, Nordbyhagen."
855,"Influenza, respiratory syncytial virus and SARS Acute lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) are a major worldwide health problem, particularly in childhood. About 30-50% of acute LRTIs are viral in origin; of these, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus are associated with the greatest disease burden in humans. Many different influenza A viruses occur naturally in animal reservoirs, and present a constant threat of zoonotic infections and global pandemics. The pandemic (H1N1) influenza virus that emerged in humans in 2009 contained a unique combination of genes originating in swine and the global human population was highly susceptible to the novel strain. The emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus in 2003, and the ensuing worldwide epidemic, highlights the fact that respiratory viral infections in humans may originate in animals. Preventative measures for influenza include annual vaccination and treatment with antiviral drugs such as the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir. Subtype-dependent resistance to antivirals can develop and should be closely monitored.  2009. (Thompson C.; Zambon M.)

856,"T cell responses are elicited against Respiratory Syncytial Virus in the absence of signalling through TLRs, RLRs and IL-1R/IL-18R Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and cytokine receptors are key players in the initiation of immune responses to infection. PRRs detecting viral RNA, such as toll like receptor (TLR)-3, -7/8, and RIG-I like receptors (RLRs; RIG-I and MDA-5), as well as cytokine receptors such as interleukin 1 receptor (IL-1R), have been implicated in responses to RNA viruses that infect the airways. The latter includes respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a human pathogen that can cause severe lower respiratory tract infections, especially in infants. To evaluate the collective contribution of PRRs and IL-1R signalling to RSV immunity, we generated Myd88/Trif/Mavs(-/-) mice that are deficient in signalling by all TLRs, RLRs and IL-1R, as well as other cytokine receptors such as IL-18 receptor. Early production of pro-inflammatory mediators and lung infiltration by immune cells were completely abrogated in infected Myd88/Trif/Mavs(-/-) mice. However, RSV-specific CD8(+) T cells were elicited and recruited into the lungs and airways. Consistent with these findings, Myd88/Trif/Mavs(-/-) mice survived RSV infection but displayed higher viral load and weight loss. These data highlight an unappreciated level of redundancy in pathways that couple innate virus sensing to adaptive immunity, providing the host with remarkable resilience to infection.

857,"Respiratory syncytial virus infection and recurrent wheezing: what next? Recent literature has provided evidence of a link between early RSV infection and chronic respiratory morbidity (recurrent wheezing, reactive airway disease and asthma). The mechanism of this association is not well understood but both genetic and environmental factors are involved. The classical studies from Sweden, Tucson and Finland are briefly summarized. Moreover new data concerning a recent multi-center international study on this topic are presented. The study, which enrolled 191 preterm infants (<or=35 wGA) who had received pelivizumab before 6 months of age and 230 who had never received pelivizumab, suggests that prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) with pelivizumab may reduce subsequent recurrent wheezing in premature infants. The INDEX study, a prospective study, will provide a useful contribution to the definition of epidemiological data on respiratory infection in preterm infants in Italy. Additional research is required to more fully understand the mechanism by which RSV leads to wheezing. (Puddu M.; Fanos V.)

858,"Respiratory syncytial infection  the current state of the problem The review shows the main current data concerning the etiology, epidemiology, pathogenesis, features of the clinical picture, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). We studied the influence of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) on the severity of the disease depending on age, concomitant pathology, genetic factors. Over the past decades, manifest forms of infection have become more frequent in the elderly, especially with weakened immunity with the development of severe forms of the disease with damage to the lower respiratory tract. During the systematization, the importance of epidemiological surveillance for RSV was determined. Data on the incidence of RSV on the territory of the subjects of Russian Federation with a high degree of probability cannot reflect the true picture, due to the lack of alertness of primary care doctors and specialists providing medical care in the inpatient departments. This is accompanied by the complexity of diagnostics and laboratory differential diagnosis with other respiratory infections. The problem is aggravated due to the lack of effective etiotropic therapy, as well as the availability of only passive immunization for children under two years of age from the means of specific prevention. Thus, these aspects raise a number of important issues for epidemiological and medical-preventive services. (Pshenichnaya N.Yu.; Gopatsa G.V.)

859,"The Use of Death Certificate Data to Characterize Mortality Associated With Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Unspecified Bronchiolitis, and Influenza in the United States, 1999-2018 Background: Death certificate data can improve our understanding of the mortality burden associated with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza. Methods: We used International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes listed on death certificates to characterize deaths from 1999 to 2018 as RSV, influenza, and unspecified bronchiolitis. We described the distribution of each cause of death by age, sex, race/ethnicity, place of death, and contributing causes of death. Results: Over the 20-year study period, RSV, bronchiolitis, and influenza were listed as the underlying causes of death on 932, 1046, and 52 293 death certificates, respectively. Children <1 year of age accounted for 39% of RSV and bronchiolitis deaths, while 72% of influenza deaths were in adults 65 years. Children <1 year were more likely to die outside of the hospital from RSV, bronchiolitis, or influenza compared to all causes (P <. 01), and black infants had the highest mortality rate for all 3 causes. Most infants dying from RSV did not have a high-risk condition listed on the death certificate. Death certificates captured 20%-60% of estimated excess RSV-attributable mortality in infants and <1% in seniors. Conclusions: Thorough reporting on death certificates is an important public health goal, especially as new therapeutics become available. Infants had higher odds of dying out of hospital from respiratory pathogens compared to other causes, and race/ethnicity alone did not explain this disparity.

860,"Humidified high-flow nasal cannula oxygen in bronchiolitis reduces need for invasive ventilation but not intensive care admission Aim: To describe the changes to paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission patterns and ventilation requirements for children with bronchiolitis following the introduction of humidified high-flow nasal cannula oxygen outside the PICU. Methods: Retrospective study comparing patients <24 months of age with a discharge diagnosis of bronchiolitis admitted to the PICU. A comparison was made between those before humidified high-flow nasal cannula oxygen use (year 2008) to those immediately following the introduction of humidified high-flow nasal cannula oxygen use (year 2011) and those following further consolidation of humidified high-flow nasal cannula oxygen use outside the PICU (year 2013). Results: Humidified high-flow nasal cannula oxygen use up to 1 L/kg/min in the hospital did not reduce PICU admission. Intubation rates were reduced from 22.2% in 2008 to 7.8% in 2013. There was a non-significant trend towards decreased length of stay in the PICU while hospital length of stay showed a significant decrease following the introduction of humidified high-flow nasal cannula oxygen. Age <6 months and respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis were associated with an increased chance of failing humidified high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy. Conclusion: Humidified high-flow nasal cannula oxygen utilised outside of the PICU in our institution for children with bronchiolitis did not reduce admission rates or length of stay to the PICU but was associated with a decreasing need for invasive ventilation and reduced hospital length of stay.

861,"Research Progress in Membrane Fusion of the Respiratory Syncytial Virus The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the most common causes of acute infection of the lower respiratory tract among children. For viruses in the Paramyxoviridae subfamily, membrane fusion requires a specific interaction between two glycoproteins: the fusion protein and attachment protein. Membrane fusion of the RSV appears to be unique among paramyxoviruses in that fusion is accomplished by the fusion protein alone without help from the attachment protein. Here, we review recent achievements and advances in the study of membrane fusion triggered by the RSV published in high-impact-factor journals. We also review and make a comparative analysis of the popular hypotheses regarding membrane fusion of the RSV. Finally, we discuss the ""hot topics"" in current research and controversial data published in recent years in the hope of providing references for Chinese researchers. (Liu X.; Wei Y.)"
862,"Respiratory syncytial virus hospitalization and incurred morbidities the season after prophylaxis Objectives: The primary objective of this study was to determine the incidence and incurred morbidities of Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-related hospitalization (RSVH), the season following completion of prophylaxis. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted of all infants enrolled in a prophylaxis clinic in one institution during the 2009 to 2014 RSV seasons. RSV infection was identified by Diseases codes and confirmed by RSV-positivity. Data were classified into five groups based on indications for prophylaxis. The incidence of RSVH was calculated. For each subgroup, differences in characteristics between children with and without RSVH were analyzed by independent t test or chi-square test. Results: During five RSV seasons, 827 infants were enrolled. RSVH incidence the season following prophylaxis was 2.1% (n=17/827). Children with chronic lung disease (CLD) had the highest RSVH incidence (7.7%; n=4/52) followed by preterms 33 to 35 weeks gestation (2.5%; n=4/162), those with complex medical disorders (2.2%; n=3/135), those with congenital heart disease (1.5%; n=1/66) and preterms less than or equal to 32 weeks gestation (1.2%; n=5/412). There was no statistically significant association between indications for prophylaxis and RSVH (Fisher exact test, P=0.060). The odds of RSVH were 4.9 times greater (odds ratio [OR]=4.9; 95% CI: 1.53, 15.55; P=0.007) in CLD compared to those without CLD. The median length of RSVH stay was 4 days; 58.8% (n=10/17) required oxygen (median 1 day); 29.4% (n=5/17) required intensive care. Conclusions: Infants with CLD are at highest risk for RSVH in the season postprophylaxis and may merit palivizumab for more than two seasons dependent on disease severity. However, larger prospective studies are necessary to confirm the findings before embarking on a strategy of providing prophylaxis for a third RSV season. (Butt M.L.)

863,"Cost-analysis of withdrawing immunoprophylaxis for respiratory syncytial virus in infants born at 33-35 weeks gestational age in Quebec: A multicenter retrospective study Background: In 2015, the Quebec Ministry of Health limited palivizumab prophylaxis for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in premature infants to those born at <33 weeks gestational age (wGA), unless other indications were present. We compared RSV-related costs for 2 seasons before the change (2013-2014, 2014-2015) and 2 seasons after (2015-2016, 2016-2017) in premature infants 33-35 wGA. Methods: Using payer and societal perspectives, costs associated with hospitalizations for RSV and lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in infants born at 33-35 wGA were estimated. Inputs were from a 2013-2017 retrospective cohort study in 25 Quebec hospitals of RSV/LRTI hospitalizations among infants <6 months old at the start of, or born during, the RSV season. Resource utilization data (hospital stay, procedures, visits, transportation, out-of-pocket expenses and work productivity) were collected from charts and parent interviews allowing estimation of direct and indirect costs. Costs, including palivizumab administration, were derived from provincial sources and adjusted to 2018 Canadian dollars. Costs were modeled for preterm infants hospitalized for RSV/LRTI pre- and postrevision of guidelines and with matched term infants hospitalized for RSV/LRTI during 2015-2017 (comparator). Results: Average total direct and indirect costs for 33-35 wGA infants were higher postrevision of guidelines ($29,208/patient, 2015-2017; n = 130) compared with prerevision ($16,976/patient, 2013-2015; n = 105). Total costs were higher in preterm infants compared with term infants (n = 234) postrevision of guidelines ($29,208/patient vs. $10,291/patient).

864,"The immune response to respiratory syncytial virus infection Respiratory syncytial virus is the primary cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants and children by 2 years of age. Pathogenesis of the RSV-induced bronchopulmonary disease is related to wide spectrum of interactions between the pathogen itself, such as activation of specific components of the immune response by viral proteins with host-depending factors affecting the course of the disease. These comprise: child's age-young infants and neonates are particularly predisposed to the severe course of RSV infection, prematurity associated with distinctive anatomical and functional properties of the respiratory tract and immaturity of the immune response, as well as genetic factors governing the innate and adaptive immunity (functional polymorphism of proinflammatory and immunoregulatory cytokines and chemokines, polymorphism of HLA antigens inducing the immune response).

Methods: a retrospective cohort study was conducted to analyze clinical outcomes in hospitalized infants with viral respiratory disease with positive results of rapid immunochro-matographic test for RSV and/or Flu-A, from 2013 to 2018. A logistic regression model was adjusted to analyze predictors of orotracheal intubation during hospitalization. Results: we analyzed 220 cases: RSV (192), Flu-A (9), co-detection (19). Lethality rate was 1.8% (2 cases), and 88% (194) were under 1 year of age. Mean time of hospitalizations was higher in patients with co-detection. Variables significantly associated with orotracheal intubation were: younger age in months, comorbidities, RSV and Flu-A co-detection, and bacterial pneumonia during hospitalization. Conclusions: RSV and Flu-Aco-detection was associated with the least favorable clinical prognoses in this study. Rapid test diagnosis may provide important information at the point of care, because molecular panels are not widely accessible in general hospitals. Rapid diagnosis allows timely evaluation and treatment.

867,"Correlates of Protection Against Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection in Infancy The highest morbidity and mortality from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection occurs in young infants. Immunization of expectant mothers during pregnancy has the potential to substantially reduce the burden of RSV disease in a majority of infants. Correlates of protection (COP) are important in guiding the development of maternal RSV vaccines and the design of maternal RSV vaccine trials, as immune response to candidate vaccines should mirror protective RSV immunity at birth. Here, we review the literature reporting correlations between RSV immune measures at birth and clinical RSV outcomes during infancy. Less than a dozen studies have investigated immunological COP with RSV disease or related hospitalization, yielding inconsistent findings overall. The differences in findings between studies could be due to differences in inclusion/exclusion criteria (e.g., the inclusion of older infants who may benefit less from maternal antibodies or infants followed during inter-seasonal periods where RSV is absent), differences in semi-quantitative RSV antibody neutralization assays, or differences in RSV outcome measures such as the sensititivity/specificity of diagnostic tests. Future research in this field should seek to standardize RSV immunological measures and outcomes, expand the breadth of functional RSV measures beyond antibody neutralization, and consider infants age and seasonality of RSV infection.

Methods: In a retrospective review over two winter seasons, 130 infants were admitted with confirmed RSV infection, of whom 39 were excluded because of either pre-existing risk factors for hyponatraemia: diuretic therapy (n = 14), cardiac disease (n=10), renal disease (n=2) or lack of admission sodium data (n=13). Results: The incidence of admission hyponatraemia in the remaining infants (median age 6 wk) was 33% (30/91), with 11% (10/91) exhibiting a serum sodium less than 130 mmoll(-1). Hyponatraemic and normonatraemic infants were of a similar age (median 6 vs 7 wk, p = 0.82). With fluid restriction and diuretic therapy, the incidence of hyponatraemia at 48 h had decreased to 3.3%, odds ratio 0.07 (95% confidence interval 0.02-0.24, p < 0.001). Four infants (4%) suffered hyponatraemic seizures at admission (sodium 114-123 mmol l (-1)); three had received hypotonic intravenous fluids at 100-150 ml kg(-1) d(-1) before referral to intensive care. All four were managed successfully with hypertonic (3%) saline, followed by fluid restriction, resulting in immediate termination of seizure activity and normalization of serum sodium values over 48 h.

869,"Influenza A in Young Children with Suspected Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection Objectives: To determine the prevalence of influenza A in young children suspected of having respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection and to compare the clinical presentation of these patients with those who have proven RSV infection. Methods: Children younger than or at 36 months of age who presented to a pediatric emergency department (ED) with suspected RSV infection during the influenza A season of 2001-2002 were eligible. Eligible children had an RSV antigen test ordered as part of their initial clinical management. A consecutive sample of children was enrolled for prospective observational analysis. The main outcome measure was the prevalence of influenza A in young children with suspected RSV infection. The secondary outcome measure was a comparison of the clinical presentations, of the two groups. Results: During the study period, 420 patients presented for evaluation of respiratory illness. RSV tests were ordered on 251 patients. Of 197 eligible patients, 124 (63%) tested positive for RSV and 33 (17%) for influenza A. Influenza A patients were more likely to have temperatures at or above 39C than RSV patients (36% vs. 15%; p = 0.01).

870,"Respiratory syncytial virus hospitalisations among young children: A data linkage study We aimed to provide comprehensive estimates of laboratory-confirmed respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-associated hospitalisations. Between 2012 and 2015, active surveillance of acute respiratory infection (ARI) hospitalisations during winter seasons was used to estimate the seasonal incidence of laboratory-confirmed RSV hospitalisations in children aged <5 years in Auckland, New Zealand (NZ). Incidence rates were estimated by fine age group, ethnicity and socio-economic status (SES) strata. Additionally, RSV disease estimates determined through active surveillance were compared to rates estimated from hospital discharge codes. There were 5309 ARI hospitalisations among children during the study period, of which 3923 (73.9%) were tested for RSV and 1597 (40.7%) were RSV-positive. The seasonal incidence of RSV-associated ARI hospitalisations, once corrected for non-testing, was 6.1 (95% confidence intervals 5.86.4) per 1000 children <5 years old. The highest incidence was among children aged <3 months. Being of indigenous Maori or Pacific ethnicity or living in a neighbourhood with low SES independently increased the risk of an RSV-associated hospitalisation. RSV hospital discharge codes had a sensitivity of 71% for identifying laboratory-confirmed RSV cases. RSV infection is a leading cause of hospitalisation among children in NZ, with significant disparities by ethnicity and SES. Our findings highlight the need for effective RSV vaccines and therapies.

871,"Pulmonary hypertension during respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis: A risk factor for severity of illness Background: Respiratory syncytial virus infection is the most frequent cause of acute lower respiratory tract disease in infants. A few reports have suggested that pulmonary hypertension is associated with increased severity of respiratory syncytial virus infection. We sought to determine the association between the pulmonary hypertension detected by echocardiography during respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis and clinical outcomes.Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 154 children admitted with respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis who had an echocardiography performed during the admission. The association between pulmonary hypertension and clinical outcomes including mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, prolonged ICU stay (>10 days), tracheal intubation, and need of high frequency oscillator ventilation was evaluated.Results: Echocardiography detected pulmonary hypertension in 29 patients (18.7%). Pulmonary hypertension was observed more frequently in patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) (n = 11/33, 33%), chronic lung disease of infancy (n = 12/25, 48%), prematurity (<37 weeks gestational age, n = 17/59, 29%), and Down syndrome (n = 4/10, 40%). The presence of pulmonary hypertension was associated with morbidity (p < 0.001) and mortality (p = 0.02). However, in patients without these risk factors (n = 68), pulmonary hypertension was detected in five patients who presented with shock or poor perfusion. Chronic lung disease was associated with pulmonary hypertension (OR = 5.9, 95% CI 2.2-16.3, p = 0.0005). Multivariate logistic analysis demonstrated that pulmonary hypertension is associated with ICU admission (OR = 6.4, 95% CI 2.2-18.8, p = 0.0007), intubation (OR = 4.7, 95% CI 1.8-12.3, p = 0.002), high frequency oscillator ventilation (OR = 8.4, 95% CI 2.95-23.98, p < 0.0001), and prolonged ICU stay (OR = 4.9, 95% CI 2.0-11.7, p = 0.0004).Conclusions: Pulmonary hypertension detected by echocardiography during respiratory syncytial virus infection was associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Chronic lung disease was associated with pulmonary hypertension detected during respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis. Routine echocardiography is not warranted for previously healthy, haemodynamically stable patients with respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis. (Kimura D., dkimura@uthsc.edu; West A.N.)

872,"Clinical and economic burden of respiratory syncytial virus in Spanish children: the BARI study Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is a major cause of morbidity in children. However, its disease burden remains poorly understood, particularly outside of the hospital setting. Our study aimed to estimate the burden of medically attended acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) cases potentially related to RSV in Spanish children. Longitudinal data from September 2017 to June 2018 of 51,292 children aged < 5 years old from the National Healthcare System (NHS) of two Spanish regions were used. Three case definitions were considered: (a) RSV-specific; (b) RSV-specific and unspecified acute bronchiolitis (RSV-specific and Bronchiolitis), and; (c) RSV-specific and unspecified ALRI (RSV-specific and ALRI). A total of 3460 medically attended ALRI cases potentially due to RSV were identified, of which 257 (7.4%), 164 (4.7%), and 3039 (87.8%) coded with RSV-specific, unspecific bronchiolitis, and unspecific ALRI codes, respectively. Medically attended RSV-specific and ALRI cases per 1000 children was 134.4 in the first year of life, 119.4 in the second, and 35.3 between 2 and 5 years old. Most cases were observed in otherwise healthy children (93.1%). Mean direct healthcare cost per medically attended RSV-specific and ALRI case was 1753 in the first year of life, 896 in the second, and 683 between 2 and 5 years old. Hospitalization was the main driver of these costs, accounting for 55.6%, 38.0% and 33.4%, in each respective age group. In RSV-specific cases, mean direct healthcare cost per medically attended case was higher, mostly due to hospitalization: 3362 in the first year of life (72.9% from hospitalizations), 3252 in the second (72.1%), and 3514 between 2 and 5 years old (74.2%). These findings suggest that hospitalization data alone will underestimate the RSV infections requiring medical care, as will relying only on RSV-specific codes. RSV testing and codification must be improved and preventive solutions adopted, to protect all infants, particularly during the first year of life.

873,"Infections with respiratory syncytial virus in North Lebanon-prevalence during winter 2008 Between 1 December 2007 and 31 May 2008, we analysed 120 nasopharyngeal swabs for the presence respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in 120 children aged 15 days to 6 years, hospitalized in 2 hospitals in North Lebanon. Of the 120 samples, 32 were positive (26.7%) for RSV. There was a peak in January which progressively disappeared from February to May. Being positive for RSV was significantly associated with the presence of rhinorrhoea and dyspnoea as clinical symptoms and the absence of pneumonia signs on chest X-ray and the diagnosis of bronchitises or bronchiolitis. Testing for RSV is important in cases of respiratory infections in children as it may limit unnecessary prescription of antibiotics. (Hamze M., mhamze@monzerhamze.com; Mallat H.; Lichaa E.; Zahab N.)

874,"Current strategies in the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus disease Infants infected with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) develop both upper and lower respiratory tract infections resulting in laryngotracheobronchitis, bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Premature infants of less than 32 weeks' gestation and those with underlying chronic lung disease are particularly susceptible and incur significant morbidity and mortality following hospitalisation. Conservative RSV prevention strategies focus on the interruption of transmission by proper hand-washing techniques and reducing exposure to potential environmental risk factors. Major challenges have impeded the development of an RSV vaccine but a licensed product may be expected in the near future. Prophylaxis with a humanised mouse monoclonal antibody (palivizumab) has been effective in reducing the rate of RSV hospitalisation in high-risk premature infants in phase II-IV trials and is available for use within internationally approved guidelines. Experimental studies evaluating the use of palivizumab in patients with congenital heart disease, those with cystic fibrosis and immunosuppressed bone marrow transplant recipients are well underway, the results of which are eagerly awaited.  2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

875,"Blocking Respiratory Syncytial Virus Entry: A Story with Twists Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is responsible for majority of infant hospitalizations due to viral infections. Despite its clinical importance, no vaccine against RSV or effective antiviral therapy is available. Several structural classes of small-molecule RSV entry inhibitor have been described and one compound has advanced to clinical testing. Mutations in either one of two resistance hot spots in the F protein mediate unusual pan-resistance to all of these inhibitor classes. Based on the biochemical characterization of resistant viruses and structural insight into the RSV F trimer, we propose a kinetic escape model as the origin of pan-resistance. Since a resistant RSV remained pathogenic in the mouse model, pan-resistance mutations could emerge rapidly in circulating RSV strains. We evaluate clinical implications and discuss consequences for the design of future RSV drug discovery campaigns.

876,"Adult respiratory distress syndrome secondary to bronchiolitis caused by respiratory syncytial virus Objectives. Bronchiolitis is an uncommon cause of adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We report the cases of two twin infants that developed ARDS secondary bronchiolitis caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Case reports. Two 45 days-old twin sisters were admitted to the PICU with ARDS 48 hours after the diagnosis of bronchiolitis. The infants were born at 28 weeks of gestation, and had developed neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, for which they had required mechanical ventilation and surfactant therapy. Patient 1 was diagnosed with RSV bronchiolitis with right upper lobe atelectasis, and required conventional and high-frequency mechanical ventilation. Her clinical course was complicated by bilateral air-leak syndrome that required drainage. An ultrasound of the brain revealed periventricular hyperechogenicity that progressed to multicystic encephalomalacia. The patient developed refractory hypoxemia and died 27 days after admission. Patient 2 was also diagnosed with RSV bronchiolitis with right upper lobe atelectasis. She required high-frequency ventilatory support and the administration of nitric oxide. Her clinical course was complicated by renal failure, and she required peritoneal dialysis. Her respiratory status progressively improved, and the patient was extubated after 45 days of admission. With long-term follow up, no neurologic deficits were detected. Comments. High-frequency ventilation and nitric oxide administration are effective therapies for patients with ARDS secondary to RSV bronchiolitis. Extra-corporal membrane oxygenation would be indicated for cases of refractory hypoxemia in the absence of neurologic deficits. The administration of specific immunoglobulin against RSV could be used prophylactically in risk patients. (Garrido R.; Pons M.; Caritg J.; Cambra F.J.; Ortega J.)

877,"Pathogenesis of respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis-related wheezing Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common cause of virus infection of the human respiratory tract during the first two years of life, with virtually all children experiencing at least one infection within this period. Although this usually leads to mild respiratory illness, some, infants develop more severe disease (bronchiolitis, pneumonia, etc.) affecting the lower airways and frequently requiring hospitalisation. There is evidence that bronchiolitis hospitalisations have increased during the last two decades and many of the hospitalised children develop wheezing later in life. The immune response to the virus is probably a major factor in the development or the expression of the pathological phenotype. In particular, a bias towards type-2 cytokine responses seems to be associated with more severe disease, whereas a type-1 response leads to more effective viral clearance and milder illness. Although the virus by itself triggers a type-1 response, a preexisting type-1 deficiency may contribute to the severity of the disease. In that sense, RSV bronchiolitis may serve as a marker, reflecting predisposition of the individual for virus induced wheezing early in life and/or asthma later in life.  2004 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The median chronological age at admission was 5.3 months, and median hospital stay was 4.0 days. Gestational age at birth was  36 weeks in 82.4% of patients. RSV disease severity was mild to moderate in 478 patients (81.0%) and severe in 110 (18.6%). Thirty-nine patients (6.6%) required pediatric intensive care unit admission, for a median of 5.0 days. Twenty-two of these patients (56%) were mechanically ventilated for a median of 6.0 days. Two children died, not attributed to RSV infection. Twenty-two patients had received palivizumab prophylaxis before hospital admission, with 18 completing at least 2 of the monthly doses.

879,"Respiratory Syncytial Virus in Older Adults: A Hidden Annual Epidemic Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common cause of medically significant respiratory tract illnesses in adults 65 years and older. The clinical presentation of RSV is largely indistinguishable from other respiratory infections including influenza, limiting awareness of its burden and impact among health care professionals and the public. Although no specific treatment in adults or licensed vaccine to prevent the disease is currently available, several promising candidate vaccines and treatments are on the horizon. Recognizing and defining the impact of RSV in older adults is important to evaluate the impact of these new prevention and treatment options. Public health and health care professionals need to be aware about RSV so they can advise the general public and older patients about the importance of prevention.

880,"Meteorological drivers of respiratory syncytial virus infections in Singapore Meteorological drivers are known to affect transmissibility of respiratory viruses including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), but there are few studies quantifying the role of these drivers. We used daily RSV hospitalization data to estimate the daily effective reproduction number (Rt), a real-time measure of transmissibility, and examined its relationship with environmental drivers in Singapore from 2005 through 2015. We used multivariable regression models to quantify the proportion of the variance in Rt explained by each meteorological driver. After constructing a basic model for RSV seasonality, we found that by adding meteorological variables into this model we were able to explain a further 15% of the variance in RSV transmissibility. Lower and higher value of mean temperature, diurnal temperature range (DTR), precipitation and relative humidity were associated with increased RSV transmissibility, while higher value of maximum wind speed was correlated with decreased RSV transmissibility. We found that a number of meteorological drivers were associated with RSV transmissibility. While indoor conditions may differ from ambient outdoor conditions, our findings are indicative of a role of ambient temperature, humidity and wind speed in affecting RSV transmission that could be biological or could reflect indirect effects via the consequences on time spent indoors.

881,"Influenza and respiratory syncytial virus infections in the oldest-old continent SARS-CoV-2 dramatically revealed the sudden impact of respiratory viruses in our lives. Influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections are associated with high rates of morbidity, mortality, and an important burden on healthcare systems worldwide, especially in elderly patients. The aim of this study was to identify severity predictors in the oldest-old admitted with influenza and/or RSV infections. This is a multicenter, retrospective study of all oldest-old patients ( 85 years old) admitted for laboratory-confirmed influenza and/or RSV infection in three tertiary hospitals in Portugal, Italy, and Cyprus over two consecutive winter seasons. The outcomes included the following: pneumonia on infection presentation, use of non-invasive ventilation (NIV), and in-hospital death (IHD). The association with possible predictors, including clinical features and type of virus infection, was assessed using uni- and multivariable analyses. A total of 251 oldest-old patients were included in the study. Pneumonia was evident in 32.3% (n = 81). NIV was implemented in 8.8% (n = 22), and IHD occurred in 13.9% (n = 35). Multivariable analyses revealed that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma was associated with pneumonia (OR 1.86; 95% CI 1.023.43; p = 0.045). COPD or asthma (OR 4.4; 95% CI 1.6711.6; p = 0.003), RSV (OR 3.12; 95% CI 1.098.92; p = 0.023), and influenza B infections (OR 3.77; 95% CI 1.0613.5; p = 0.041) were associated with NIV use, respectively, while chronic kidney disease was associated with IHD (OR 2.50; 95% CI 1.145.51; p = 0.023). Among the oldest-old, chronic organ failure, such as COPD or asthma, and CKD predicted pneumonia and IHD, respectively, beyond the importance of viral virulence itself. These findings could impact on public health policies, such as fostering influenza immunization campaigns, home-based care programs, and end-of-life care. Filling knowledge gaps is crucial to set priorities and advise on transition model of care that best fits the oldest-old.

882,"Treatment of respiratory syncytial virus with palivizumab: A systematic review Background: Palivizumab has proven efficacy for prophylaxis of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in infants with prematurity or congenital heart disease. Despite a paucity of data, palivizumab is sometimes used to prevent progression when high-risk patients present with upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) due to RSV, or as therapy when any patients present with severe lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) caused by RSV. Methods: A systematic review of the literatures on the use of palivizumab as therapy for RSV was conducted. The primary outcomes were progression from URTI to LRTI and survival rates. Secondary outcomes were adverse events due to palivizumab, serum palivizumab level, and RSV concentration in respiratory secretions. Results: The search yielded 1 case report, 4 case series, and 2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 136 adults and children. The RCTs were not powered to look at clinical outcomes. By combining all reported clinical outcomes, 3 (12%) of 25 patients with URTI who were given palivizumab died of RSV and 5 of 88 patients with LRTI at the time of treatment died of RSV (6%). Palivizumab levels appeared to be adequate for at least 3 weeks of intravenous injection at 15 mg/kg. The therapy resulted in decreased RSV concentrations in tracheal secretions. Conclusion: Larger RCTs will be required before palivizumab can be recommended as therapy for RSV in any clinical setting.  2010 Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

885,"National Evidence in Israel Supporting Reevaluation of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Prophylactic Guidelines Background: The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recently narrowed the indications for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) prophylaxis, while in Israel the guidelines have not changed. Objective: To compare the prevalence and severity of RSV infection among preterm infants born earlier than 34(0)/(7) weeks of gestation (PI), late preterm infants born at 34(0)/(7)-36(6)/(7) weeks (LPTI), and term infants born after 37(0)/(7) weeks of gestation (TI) and to determine whether the results support a change in local policy. Methods: Data of all children aged 0-14 years hospitalized with PCR-positive RSV in a single tertiary center from 2010 to 2014 were collected. A total of 793 children were included and divided into 3 groups: 637 were TI, 105 were LPTI, and 50 were PI. These groups were compared regarding incidence of hospitalization due to RSV infection, intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalization, and length of hospitalization. Results: The hospitalization rate due to RSV infection was 5.2, 3.5, and 1.3% among PI, LPTI, and TI, respectively (p < 0.01). The hospitalization rate in the ICU was 24, 7.6, and 3% among PI, LPTI, and TI, respectively (p < 0.001). The length (days) of hospitalization was significantly longer among PI compared with LPTI and TI (p < 0.001). Overall, the hospitalization rate and disease severity were significantly higher for infants born earlier than 35 weeks of gestation compared with more maturely born infants. Conclusion: RSV infection remains a major cause of morbidity among children born prematurely even after RSV prophylaxis and would probably be greater were prophylaxis curtailed. Our results do not support applying the current AAP guidelines in Israel. Further local studies are needed to optimize prophylaxis for both PI and LPTI.

886,"Recognizing the importance of respiratory syncytial virus in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are responsible for a large proportion of the health care dollar expenditure, morbidity, and mortality related to COPD. Respiratory infections are the most common cause of acute exacerbations, but recent evidence indicates that the importance of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in COPD is under-appreciated. Improved detection of RSV using techniques based on the polymerase chain reaction accounts for much of the increased recognition of the importance of this virus in COPD patients. Furthermore, COPD patients may be more susceptible to RSV infection, possibly due to RSV-or immune response-induced pulmonary effects that are altered by age, environmental exposures, genetics, COPD itself, or a combination of these. However, although RSV infection occurs throughout life, viral and host factors that place COPD patients at increased risk are unclear. The complexities of RSV effects in COPD present opportunities for research with the goal of developing approaches to selectively modify damaging viral effects (e.g., altered airway function), while retaining beneficial immunity (e.g., clearance of virus) in COPD patients. This review explores the role RSV plays in acute exacerbations of COPD, the potential for RSV disease in chronic stable COPD, and newer concepts in RSV diagnosis, epidemiology, and host defense.

Design: Retrospective descriptive study. Setting: Australian ICUs contributing data to the Australian and New Zealand Paediatric Intensive Care (ANZPIC) Registry. The number of contributing ICUs increased over the study period, from 8 specialist paediatric ICUs in 1997 to 8 specialist paediatric and 13 general ICUs in 2013. Participants: All paediatric (<16 years) ICU admissions, coded as pertussis-related, between 1 January 1997 and 31 December 2013. Results: A total of 373 pertussis-coded ICU admissions were identified in the ANZPIC Registry over the study period. Of these cases, 52.8% occurred during the 4 years of the recent Australian epidemic (2009-2012). ICU admissions were most likely to occur in infants aged younger than 6 weeks (41.8%, n=156) and aged 6 weeks to 4 months (42.9%, n=160). The median length of stay for pertussis related ICU admissions was 3.6 days, with 77.5% of cases staying in ICU for <7 days. Approximately half of all admissions (54.8%) required some form of respiratory support, with 32.7% requiring invasive respiratory support. Over the study period, 23 deaths were recorded (6.2% of pertussis-related ICU admissions), of which 20 (87.0%) were infants <4 months old. Conclusions: Pertussis-related ICU admissions occur primarily in infants too young to be fully protected from active immunisation. More needs to be done to protect these high-risk infants, such as maternal immunisation. (Kaczmarek M.C., m.kaczmarek@uq.edu.au; Ware R.S.; Lambert S.B.)

889,"Low incidence of respiratory syncytial virus hospitalisations in haemodynamically significant congenital heart disease Background: Haemodynamically significant congenital heart disease (CHD) is a risk factor for severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease in young children. Population based data on the incidence of RSV hospitalisations in CHD patients are needed to estimate the potential usefulness of RSV immunoprophylaxis using palivizumab. Aims: (1) To obtain population based RSV hospitalisation rates in children <24 months of age with CHD. (2) To compare these rates with non-CHD patients and with previous studies. (3) To determine the number of patients needed to treat (NNT) with palivizumab to prevent one RSV hospitalisation. Methods: Six year, longitudinal, population based study at an institution, which is the sole provider of primary to tertiary in-patient care for a precisely defined paediatric population. Results: RSV hospitalisation rates (per 100 child-years) in CHD patients aged <6, <12, 12-24, and <24 months of age were 2.5 (95% Cl 0.8 to 5.6), 2.0 (0.8 to 3.8), 0.5 (0.1 to 1.8), and 1.3 (0.6 to 2.3), respectively, and the relative risk (RR) in comparison with non-CHD patients was 1.4 (0.6 to 3.1), 1.6 (0.8 to 3.2), 2.7 (0.7 to 9.7), and 1.8 (1.0 to 3.3), respectively. NNT was between 80 (35 to 245) and 259 (72 to 2140) for various age groups. Conclusion: RSV hospitalisation rates in CHD patients were fourfold lower than reported from the USA.

890,"Risk of concurrent bacterial infection in preterm infants hospitalized due to respiratory syncytial virus infection Objective: To evaluate the risk of concurrent bacterial infection in preterm infants hospitalized due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease. Patients and methods: Retrospective cohort analysis of all infants hospitalized due to RSV infection between January 1, 2001 and July 31, 2005. Patients were identified by ICD-10 diagnosis of RSV infection including codes J21.0, J21.9, J12.1, J20.5 and B97.4. Medical charts were reviewed and RSV infection had to be confirmed by positive antigen detection test on nasopharyngeal aspirates. Results: A total of 464 infants had been hospitalized due to RSV infection and 42 (9.1%) were born <37 weeks of gestational age. Concurrent bacterial infections were diagnosed by either positive blood or urine cultures, stool culture, tracheal aspirates or smears in 4 of 42 preterm (9.5%) compared to 13 of 422 term (3.1%) infants (p = 0.017, RR 3.092, CI 95% 1.251-7.641). Excluding the infants admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) the total rate of bacterial co-infection was 1.9%. Ten of 42 preterm (23.8 %) compared to 25 of 422 term (5.2 %) infants were referred to ICU (p < 0.001, RR 3.349, CI 95% 1.882-5.959). All preterm infants had pneumonia, and isolates were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Streptococcus pneumoniae with Haemophilus influenzae. Mean length of stay in preterm infants with bacterial co-infection was 22.3 days compared to 10.3 days without bacterial co-infection (p < 0.006). Conclusion: The overall low risk of concurrent bacterial infection was significantly increased in preterm infants associated with prolonged hospitalization and ICU admission.  2007 The Author(s).

891,"Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection in Infants and Young Children Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infects nearly all children by age 2 years and is the leading cause of hospitalization in infants and young children. Most children present with mild, cold-like disease, but susceptible individuals may develop severe disease. No vaccine is available for prevention of RSV in infants and children; however, in high-risk patients, immunoprophylaxis with the monoclonal antibody palivizumab may be considered during RSV season. RSV treatment remains largely supportive in nature, including fever control, rehydration, nutritional support, secretion clearance, and oxygen support, if needed. Antiviral therapy may be considered in patients with severe disease. Pharmacists have a key role in identifying candidates for palivizumab during RSV season and providing education on nonpharmacologic preventive measures that can be undertaken to lessen the spread of RSV.

892,"Assessing Uncertainty in A2 Respiratory Syncytial Virus Viral Dynamics Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children younger than 1 year of age in the United States. Moreover, RSV is being recognized more often as a significant cause of respiratory illness in older adults. Although RSV has been studied both clinically and in vitro, a quantitative understanding of the infection dynamics is still lacking. In this paper, we study the effect of uncertainty in the main parameters of a viral kinetics model of RSV. We first characterize the RSV replication cycle and extract parameter values by fitting the mathematical model to in vivo data from eight human subjects. We then use Monte Carlo numerical simulations to determine how uncertainty in the parameter values will affect model predictions. We find that uncertainty in the infection rate, eclipse phase duration, and infectious lifespan most affect the predicted dynamics of RSV. This study provides the first estimate of in vivo RSV infection parameters, helping to quantify RSV dynamics. Our assessment of the effect of uncertainty will help guide future experimental design to obtain more precise parameter values.

893,"Clinical and economic outcomes associated with respiratory syncytial virus vaccination in older adults in the United States Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an important cause of lower respiratory infections and hospitalizations among older adults. We aimed to estimate the potential clinical benefits and economic value of RSV vaccination of older adults in the United States (US). Methods: We developed an economic model using a decision-tree framework to capture outcomes associated with RSV infections in US adults aged  60 years occurring during one RSV season for a hypothetical vaccine versus no vaccine. Two cobase-case epidemiology sources were selected from a targeted review of the US literature: a landmark study capturing all RSV infections and a contemporary study reporting medically attended RSV that also distinguishes mild from moderate-to-severe disease. Both base-case analyses used recent data on mortality risk in the year after RSV hospitalizations. Direct medical costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) lost per case were obtained from the literature and publicly available sources. Model outcomes included the population-level clinical and economic RSV disease burden among older adults, potential vaccine-avoidable disease burden, and the potential value-based price of a vaccine from a third-party payer perspective. Results: Our two base-case analyses estimated that a vaccine with 50% efficacy and coverage matching that of influenza vaccination would prevent 43,70081,500 RSV hospitalizations and 8,00014,900 RSV-attributable deaths per RSV season, resulting in 1,8003,900 fewer QALYs lost and avoiding $557-$1,024 million. Value-based prices for the cobase-case analyses were $152-$299 per vaccination at a willingness to pay of $100,000/QALY gained. Sensitivity analyses found that the economic value of vaccination was most sensitive to RSV incidence and increased posthospitalization mortality risks. Conclusions: Despite variability and gaps in the epidemiology literature, this study highlights the potential value of RSV vaccination for older adults in the US. Our analysis provides contemporary estimates of the population-level RSV disease burden and insights into the economic value drivers for RSV vaccination.

895,"Lung dendritic cells in respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis, an important respiratory disease in infancy, is thought to be caused by severe inflammation of the small peripheral airways and has been associated with the development of recurrent wheeze, childhood asthma, and early allergen sensitization. Both innate and adaptive immune responses are thought to contribute to the development of bronchiolitis in RSV infection. If vaccination and specific therapy for bronchiolitis, which are currently lacking, are to be developed, detailed understanding of the immune responses involved is essential. Dendritic cells (DCs) are uniquely positioned to link innate to adaptive immune responses and may therefore be central to the development of bronchiolitis. In murine models, plasmacytoid DCs are recruited to the lung early in infection, presumably from the bone marrow, whereas lung myeloid DCs increase in numbers later in infection, with the advent of inflammation, and are derived from local lung precursors. Plasmacytoid DCs limit viral replication and they may have additional regulatory properties controlling pulmonary inflammation and lung function changes during bronchiolitis. In contrast, lung myeloid DCs are likely to contribute to inflammation during and after bronchiolitis and they may also facilitate sensitization to allergens. Myeloid DCs mature upon RSV infection and become potent activators of naive T cells, whereas in healthy lungs they are mostly immature and unable to stimulate naive T cells. As central players in the induction of adaptive immune responses, lung DCs need to be considered as targets for novel therapies and vaccination approaches. (Schwarze J.)

896,"Respiratory syncytial virus: How, why and what to do Bronchiolitis is the leading cause of hospitalization of infants and young children worldwide. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of bronchiolitis in infants. Studies conducted using molecular diagnostic assays confirmed that RSV accounts for over 50% of bronchiolitis in young children requiring hospitalization. Those studies demonstrate that it is common to identify RSV in association with a second viral agent but it is yet unclear whether the simultaneous detection of two or even three viruses is associated with increased disease severity. Despite extensive efforts, a vaccine for prevention of RSV infection is not yet available. Palivizumab a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the F protein of RSV is the only agent licensed to prevent severe RSV disease in high-risk children. Among the new antivirals being developed for treatment of RSV infections, an RNA-interference based agent has demonstrated promising results for treatment of lung transplant recipients with acute RSV infection.  2013.

The drug is approved for use for different indications in different Canadian provinces. The drug should be administered only in the context of infants most vulnerable to severe RSV illness with a high likelihood of hospital admission, particularly in the first 6 months of life.

898,"Respiratory syncytial virus activity--United States, 1999-2000 season. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of lower respiratory tract illness (LRTI) among infants and children worldwide (1) and is an important cause of LRTI among older children and adults (2). Despite the presence of maternal antibodies, most hospitalizations occur among infants aged <6 months, and nearly all children are infected by age 2 years (3). Although primary infection is usually most severe, reinfection throughout life is common (4). In temperate climates, RSV infections occur primarily during annual outbreaks, which peak during winter months (5). In the United States, RSV activity is monitored by the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS), a voluntary, laboratory-based system. This report summarizes trends in RSV activity reported to NREVSS from July 1999 through June 2000 and presents preliminary surveillance data from July 8 through November 21, 2000, which indicate that RSV community outbreaks are becoming widespread.

903,"Palivizumab Prophylaxis, Respiratory Syncytial Virus, and Subsequent Recurrent Wheezing Objective: Children who experience respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) early in life have high rates of subsequent recurrent wheezing. Palivizumab, an anti-RSV monoclonal antibody, has 78% to 80% efficacy in preventing RSV hospitalization in premature infants without chronic lung disease. We hypothesized that palivizumab, by ameliorating or preventing early RSV LRTI in preterm infants, might decrease later recurrent wheezing. Study design: A cohort of preterm infants who had received palivizumab and were not hospitalized for RSV (n = 191) or who never received palivizumab (n = 230; 76 who were hospitalized for RSV and 154 who were not), were prospectively followed for 24 months beginning at a mean age of 19 months. The subjects were assessed for recurrent wheezing by caretaker or physician report. Results: The incidences of recurrent wheezing and physician-diagnosed recurrent wheezing were significantly lower in the 191 palivizumab-treated subjects (13% and 8%, respectively) compared with all 230 untreated subjects (26%, P = .001 and 16%, P = .011, respectively) and with the 154 patients in the subgroup not hospitalized for RSV LRTI (23%, P = .022 and 16%, P = .027, respectively). The effect of palivizumab treatment remained significant after adjustment for potential confounding variables.

904,"Comparative analysis of Respiratory Syncytial Virus frequency rates and viral load in different patient cohorts in a University Hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil, over an eight-year period (20052013) Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) poses a global health concern, particularly affecting young children, the elderly, and immunosuppressed individuals. RSV viral load is essential for understanding transmission, disease severity, prevention, and treatment. This retrospective study aimed to analyze the frequency rates and viral loads of RSV infections in different patient cohorts and age groups over an eight-year period in a university hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil. This study analyzed 1380 Immunocompetent (IC) and Immunosuppressed (IS) patients with acute respiratory tract infections. IC included patients with chronic Heart Disease (HD), Primary Care service recipients (PC), and a subgroup suspected of having Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome caused by Influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus (SARS H1N1). IS comprised transplant patients and those with HIV infection. Respiratory samples were collected between February 2005 and October 2013, with RSV detection and viral load quantification (Log10 copies of RNA/mL) using RT-qPCR. Overall RSV infection rate was 17.3 %, with higher rates in children (23.9 %) than in adults (12.9 %), particularly in children under two years of age (28.2 %). Children in the SARS H1N1 and PC subgroups had higher infection rates (16.4 % and 34.9 %, respectively), with the highest rate in PC children aged 1 to < 2 years (45.45 %). Adults with HD had a significantly higher frequency rate (27.83 %) than those in the SARS H1N1 (2.65 %) and IS (15.16 %) subgroups and higher hospitalization rate among adults under 65 years. RSV viral load ranged from 2.43 to 10.15 Log10 RNA copies/mL (mean  SD 5.82  2.19), with hospitalized patients exhibiting significantly higher viral loads (7.34  1.9) than outpatients (4.38  1.89). Elderly bone marrow transplant patients also had significantly higher viral loads (7.57  2.41) than younger adults (5.12  1.87). This study provides insights into the RSV infection patterns in different patient cohorts in Brazil. Further investigations are needed to understand susceptibility and risk factors associated with RSV infection. In conclusion, high RSV viral load among hospitalized patients could serve as a surrogate marker of disease severity. Additionally, patients with chronic heart disease deserve greater attention regarding complications associated with RSV infection.

907,"Respiratory syncytial virus tracking using internet search engine data BACKGROUND: Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is the leading cause of hospitalization in children less than 1 year of age in the United States. Internet search engine queries may provide high resolution temporal and spatial data to estimate and predict disease activity. METHODS: After filtering an initial list of 613 symptoms using high-resolution Bing search logs, we used Google Trends data between 2004 and 2016 for a smaller list of 50 terms to build predictive models of RSV incidence for five states where long-term surveillance data was available. We then used domain adaptation to model RSV incidence for the 45 remaining US states. RESULTS: Surveillance data sources (hospitalization and laboratory reports) were highly correlated, as were laboratory reports with search engine data. The four terms which were most often statistically significantly correlated as time series with the surveillance data in the five state models were RSV, flu, pneumonia, and bronchiolitis. Using our models, we tracked the spread of RSV by observing the time of peak use of the search term in different states. In general, the RSV peak moved from south-east (Florida) to the north-west US. CONCLUSIONS: Our study represents the first time that RSV has been tracked using Internet data results and highlights successful use of search filters and domain adaptation techniques, using data at multiple resolutions. Our approach may assist in identifying spread of both local and more widespread RSV transmission and may be applicable to other seasonal conditions where comprehensive epidemiological data is difficult to collect or obtain.

Study design: A systematic search of available databases for studies reporting the rate of apnea in a consecutive cohort of infants hospitalized with RSV infection was performed. The overall incidence of apnea was extracted and analyzed in relation to preterm birth, age, and potentially confounding illnesses. Results: The incidence of apnea in the study population of 5575 hospitalized patients with RSV ranged from a high of 23.8% to a low of 1.2%. Comparison of the cohort by term and preterm birth revealed an expected excess in apnea incidence in preterms, even in the absence of information about chronologic age. Many studies appeared to be confounded by the inclusion of impaired infants with neuromuscular disorders. Conclusions: Based on the available data, precisely quantifying the risk of apnea attributable to RSV infection is not possible. Factors intrinsic to the individual infants may account for a significant percentage of the apnea attributed to RSV.

909,"Incidence and severity of pertussis in infants with a respiratory syncytial virus infection Introduction: Pertussis is a re-emerging disease that mostly affects infants. At this age, the severity can be affected by intercurrent infections such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Objectives: To estimate the incidence of RSV infection during an epidemic period in patients hospitalized due to pertussis. The impact on the severity was also observed during hospitalization. Patients and method: A descriptive study of cases diagnosed with pertussis admitted to a tertiary hospital over a 3 year period, where the presence of co-infection with RSV was analyzed. The estimate of severity was estimated using the incidence of complications and the level of care required. Results: From a total of 73 infants with pertussis, 34 occurred in a bronchiolitis season epidemic. A coinfection due to RSV was detected in 17 patients. The mean age was not significantly different compared to the non co-infected. The mean stay and the need for intensive care was similar in both groups. The need for oxygen therapy care and nutritional support was higher in the coinfected patients. Conclusions: Coinfection with RSV in infants hospitalized with pertussis occurred in ono in 2 patients during a RSV epidemic season, in infants of similar age. Severity in terms of stay, presence of apnea and admission to intensive care was similar, but more need for respiratory care and nutritional support was found.

912,"Risk factors for respiratory syncytial virus hospitalisation in children with heart disease Objective: To assess the risk and risk factors for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) hospitalisation and determinants of the severity of RSV disease in children with heart disease. Methods: By using a database on RSV tests in Denmark all children with RSV diagnosed with heart disease in Denmark from January 1996 to April 2003 were identified. For each case child one control child matched for age and centre was drawn from the population of children with heart disease. Clinical information was obtained through a review of all records. Results: Data were obtained on 313 pairs. Median age at admission was 280 days (range 15-2379). In the multivariate analysis predictors of RSV hospitalisation were Down syndrome (odds ratio (OR) 3.24, 95% CI 1.80 to 5.80), cardiomyopathy (OR 5.84, 95% CI 1.26 to 27.16) and haemodynamically significant heart disease (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.26). During RSV hospitalisation predictors of the need for respiratory support (supplemental oxygen, nasal continuous positive airway pressure or mechanical ventilation) were young age (relative risk (RR) 0.47, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.67 per additional year of age) and cardiac decompensation (RR 1.81, 95% CI 1.02 to 3.23). The incidence rate of RSV hospitalisation among children with any heart disease aged 0-23 months was 5.65 per 100 child-years. Conclusion: In children with heart disease risk factors for RSV admission are Down syndrome, cardiomyopathy and haemodynamically significant heart disease. Young age and cardiac decompensation are associated with a more severe course of RSV disease.

914,"Respiratory syncytial virus - Associated lower respiratory tract infections in hospitalized infants For analysis of clinical features and outcome of hospitalized infants with respiratory syncytial virus lower respiratory tract infection, was carried out. Cross-sectional study with 89 infants, hospitalized in two public hospitals during the 1997 and 1998 RSV seasons, in Rio de Janeiro city. Nasopharyngeal secretions were obtained and specimens processed for viral antigens detection by indirect immunofluorescence assay with the use of anti RSV, antiinfluenza A and B and anti parainfluenza type 3 monoclonal antibodies. Patients were allocated into three diagnostic groups: bronchiolitis or wheeze bronchitis (n = 44); Pneumonia (n = 26) and bronchiolitis or wheeze bronchitis and pneumonia (n = 19). Positivity for RSV was found in 42 (47.1%) patients. More days of hospitalization were seen in 1997 in comparison with the follow year (p > 0.05). No clinical differences were found between RSV positive and negative children. The sensitivity and specificity for wheezing concerning the isolation of RSg were, respectively, 85% and 65%.

915,"Severe human lower respiratory tract illness caused by respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus is characterized by the absence of pulmonary cytotoxic lymphocyte responses Background. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus are common causes of infantile lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). It is widely believed that both viral replication and inappropriately enhanced immune responses contribute to disease severity. In infants, RSV LRTI is known to be more severe than influenza virus LRTI. Methods. We compared cytokines and chemokines in secretions of infants surviving various forms of respiratory illness caused by RSV or influenza viruses, to determine which mediators were associated with more-severe illness. We analyzed lung tissue from infants with fatal cases of RSV and influenza virus LRTI to determine the types of inflammatory cells present. Autopsy tissues were studied for the lymphotoxin granzyme and the apoptosis marker caspase 3. Results. Quantities of lymphocyte-derived cytokines were minimal in secretions from infants with RSV infection. Concentrations of most cytokines were greater in influenza virus, rather than RSV, infection. Lung tissues from infants with fatal RSV and influenza virus LRTI demonstrated an extensive presence of viral antigen and a near absence of CD8-positive lymphocytes and natural killer cells, with marked expression of markers of apoptosis. Conclusions. Severe infantile RSV and influenza virus LRTI is characterized by inadequate (rather than excessive) adaptive immune responses, robust viral replication, and apoptotic crisis.  2007 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

916,"Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV): a review. Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) infection is the major cause of respiratory disease in calves during the first year of life. The study of the virus has been difficult because of its lability and very poor growth in cell culture. However, during the last decade, the introduction of new immunological and biotechnological techniques has facilitated a more extensive study of BRSV as illustrated by the increasing number of papers published. Despite this growing focus, many aspects of the pathogenesis, epidemiology, immunology etc. remain obscure. The course and outcome of the infection is very complex and unpredictable which makes the diagnosis and subsequent therapy very difficult. BRSV is closely related to human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) which is an important cause of respiratory disease in young children. In contrast to BRSV, the recent knowledge of HRSV is regularly extensively reviewed in several books and journals. The present paper contains an updated review on BRSV covering most aspects of the structure, molecular biology, pathogenesis, pathology, clinical features, epidemiology, diagnosis and immunology based on approximately 140 references from international research journals.

917,"Clinical predictors of respiratory syncytial virus infection in children Aim: The aim of this study was to develop a clinical prediction model that identifies respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in infants and young children. Methods: Children  36 months of age with respiratory illness, who were suspected of having RSV infection, were enrolled in this prospective cohort study during the study period between January and February 2002. RSV testing was performed on all patients. Results: Of the 197 patients enrolled in the study, 126 (64%) were positive for RSV and 71 (36%) patients were either negative for RSV or had a positive culture for viruses other than RSV. The mean age of patients was 5 months and 57% were male. Backwards stepwise logistic regression analysis identified cough (p = 0.000), wheezing (p = 0.002), and retractions (p = 0.008) as independent variables predictive of RSV infection. The prediction model had a sensitivity of 80% (95% CI, 71-87%), specificity of 68% (95% CI, 54-79%), positive predictive value 82% (95% CI, 74-89%), negative predictive value 66% (95% CI, 52-77), positive likelihood ratio 2.5 (95% CI, 1.8-3.7) and post-test probability of 82%.

918,"Functional correlations of respiratory syncytial virus proteins to intrinsic disorder Protein intrinsic disorder is an important characteristic demonstrated by the absence of higher order structure, and is commonly detected in multifunctional proteins encoded by RNA viruses. Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of proteins exhibit high flexibility and solvent accessibility, which permit several distinct protein functions, including but not limited to binding of multiple partners and accessibility for post-translational modifications. IDR-containing viral proteins can therefore execute various functional roles to enable productive viral replication. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a globally circulating, non-segmented, negative sense (NNS) RNA virus that causes severe lower respiratory infections. In this study, we performed a comprehensive evaluation of predicted intrinsic disorder of the RSV proteome to better understand the functional role of RSV protein IDRs. We included 27 RSV strains to sample major RSV subtypes and genotypes, as well as geographic and temporal isolate differences. Several types of disorder predictions were applied to the RSV proteome, including per-residue (PONDR-FIT and PONDR VL-XT), binary (CH, CDF, CH-CDF), and disorder-based interactions (ANCHOR and MoRFpred). We classified RSV IDRs by size, frequency and function. Finally, we determined the functional implications of RSV IDRs by mapping predicted IDRs to known functional domains of each protein. Identification of RSV IDRs within functional domains improves our understanding of RSV pathogenesis in addition to providing potential therapeutic targets. Furthermore, this approach can be applied to other NNS viruses that encode essential multifunctional proteins for the elucidation of viral protein regions that can be manipulated for attenuation of viral replication.

919,"Progress in immune prevention of respiratory syncytial virus infection in children Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important viral pathogen causing acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRTI) in children under 5 years worldwide.RSV is also the primary viral factor leading to ALRTI hospitalization in infants under 1 year.Children are generally susceptible to RSV, and 90% of infants have been infected with RSV before 2 years, which seriously endangers childrens health.Since the discovery of RSV in 1950s, a large number of experiments and explorations on RSV vaccine have been conducted at home and abroad.Nevertheless, there is still no approved RSV vaccine.A breakthrough progress has been made on biological products for the prevention of RSV infection (maternal antibody vaccine, prophylactic monoclonal antibody, etc.), and some of them have entered phase 3 clinical trials.Therefore, it is expected to have effective interventions for preventing RSV infection via passive immune in the next 5-10 years.The Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization of the World Health Organization reviewed the development of two passive immune agents (maternal antibody vaccine and monoclonal antibody for prevention) in April 2016 to guide the follow-up research.This study systematically reviews the history of passive immunization for the prevention of infectious diseases and the progress in RSV preventive immunization, and summarizes the evidence-based evidence of passive immunity used to prevent RSV infection-related diseases.

920,"Clinical and Socioeconomic Burden of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection in Children Background. Vaccines and antivirals against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are being developed, but there are scarce data on the full impact of RSV infection on outpatient children. Methods. We analyzed the burden of RSV illness in a prospective cohort study of children aged 13 years during 2 consecutive respiratory seasons in Turku, Finland (2231 child-seasons of follow-up). We examined the children and obtained nasal swabs for the detection of RSV during each respiratory illness. The parents filled out daily symptom diaries throughout the study. Results. Of 6001 medically attended respiratory infections, 302 (5%) were caused by RSV. Per 1000 children, the average annual RSV infection incidence rates among children aged <3, 36, and 713 years were 275, 117, and 46 cases, respectively. In children aged <3 years, acute otitis media developed in 58%, and 66% of children in this age group received antibiotics. The mean duration of RSV illness was longest (13.0 days) and the rate of parental work absenteeism was highest (136 days per 100 children with RSV illness) in children aged <3 years. Conclusions. The burden of RSV is particularly great among outpatient children aged <3 years. Young children are an important target group for the development of RSV vaccines and antivirals.

921,"Epidemiology of hospitalization for acute bronchiolitis in children: Differences between RSV and non-RSV bronchiolitis We study the clinical, management and outcome differences between respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) positive and negative bronchiolitis. A retrospective review of the medical records of children  2 years of age with acute bronchiolitis between January 1995 and December 2006 was done. There were 2,384 patients hospitalized for acute bronchiolitis, and 1,495 (62.7%) were RSV infections. Overall, hospitalization rate was 55/1,000 admissions. Mortality occurred in 0.08% of cases. Bronchiolitis due to RSV was more frequent from November to March (97%). RSV bronchiolitis had longer hospital stays (6 vs. 5 days, P<0.0001), higher risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admission (OR 2.7; 95%CI 1.87-3.9) and more oxygen use (OR 2.2; 95%CI 1.8-2.6). Infants < 2 months had longer median hospital stay (6 vs. 5 days, P <0.0001) and higher risk of ICU admission (OR 3.4; 95%CI 2.5-4.6). Prematures of < 32 gestational weeks, congenital heart disease, and atelectasis/ condensation were the main risk factors for ICU admission in both RSV and non-RSV bronchiolitis. The introduction of palivizumab in prematures diminished hospitalization for RSV bronchiolitis, oxygen need, length of hospital stay and mechanical ventilation.

922,"Incidence and severity of pertussis in infants with a respiratory syncytial virus infection Introduction Pertussis is a re-emerging disease that mostly affects infants. At this age, the severity can be affected by intercurrent infections such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Objectives To estimate the incidence of RSV infection during an epidemic period in patients hospitalized due to pertussis. The impact on the severity was also observed during hospitalization. Patients and method A descriptive study of cases diagnosed with pertussis admitted to a tertiary hospital over a 3 year period, where the presence of co-infection with RSV was analyzed. The estimate of severity was estimated using the incidence of complications and the level of care required. Results From a total of 73 infants with pertussis, 34 occurred in a bronchiolitis season epidemic. A co-infection due to RSV was detected in 17 patients. The mean age was not significantly different compared to the non co-infected. The mean stay and the need for intensive care was similar in both groups. The need for oxygen therapy care and nutritional support was higher in the coinfected patients. Conclusions Coinfection with RSV in infants hospitalized with pertussis occurred in ono in 2 patients during a RSV epidemic season, in infants of similar age. Severity in terms of stay, presence of apnea and admission to intensive care was similar, but more need for respiratory care and nutritional support was found.

923,"Clinical outcomes of adults hospitalized for laboratory confirmed respiratory syncytial virus or influenza virus infection Objectives Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) can cause severe disease in adults, but far less is known than for influenza. The aim of our study was to compare the disease course of RSV infections with influenza infections among hospitalized adults. Methods We retrieved clinical data from an ongoing surveillance of adults hospitalized with RSV or influenza virus infection in two acute care hospitals in North-Eastern Switzerland during the winter seasons 2017/2018 and 2018/2019. Our main analysis compared the odds between RSV and influenza patients for admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) or in-hospital death within 7 days after admission. Results There were 548 patients, of whom 79 (14.4%) had an RSV and 469 (85.6%) an influenza virus infection. Both groups were similar with respect to age, sex, smoking status, nutritional state, and comorbidities. More RSV patients had an infiltrate on chest radiograph on admission (46.4% vs 29.9%, p = .007). The proportion of patients with RSV who died or were admitted to ICU within seven days after admission was 19.0% compared to 10.2% in influenza patients (p = .024). In multivariable analysis, a higher leukocyte count (adjusted OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.021.13, p = .013) and the presence of a pneumonic infiltrate (aOR 3.41, 95% CI 1.936.02) significantly increased the risk for experiencing the adverse primary outcome while the effect of the underlying viral pathogen became attenuated (aOR 1.18, 95% CI 0.582.41, p = .0.655). Conclusions Our results suggest that RSV is responsible for clinical courses at least as severe as influenza in adults. This supports the need for better guidance on diagnostic strategies as well as on preventive and therapeutic measures for hospitalized adults with RSV infection.

924,"Autonomic dysfunction with early respiratory syncytial virus-related infection Background: Apparent life-threatening events (ALTE) and/or prolonged apnoea have been well-documented during respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in infants less than 2. months of age but fundamental mechanisms remain unclear. The possibility of a central origin for the development of severe cardiac and respiratory events encouraged us, to explore the autonomic nervous system (ANS) profile of infected infants, since ANS activity may contribute to the constellation of symptoms observed during severe forms of RSV bronchiolitis. Methods: Eight infants (2 preterm and 6 full-term) less than 2. months of age and presenting with severe and apnoeic forms of RSV infection were evaluated using non-invasive electrophysiological monitoring obtained simultaneously for approximately 2 consecutive hours, including a quiet sleep period. Eight control subjects, paired for gestational and postnatal age, were also evaluated. ANS status was monitored using electrocardiogram recordings and quantified through a frequency-domain analysis of heart rate variability (HRV). This included sympathetic (VLF and LF) and parasympathetic (HF) indices as well as a measure of baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) obtained using non-invasive continuous arterial pressure. Results: Regardless of gestational and postnatal age, heart rate variability components (Ptot, VLF, LF, and HF) and baroreflex components ( LF,  HF and sBR) were found to be significantly lower in the RSV-infected group than in the control group (p< 0.05).

925,"Monoclonal Antibodies for Prevention of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of hospitalizations in infants worldwide. Palivizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against the RSV F protein, is the only licensed agent for prevention of severe RSV infection in high-risk infants. Palivizumab is administered intramuscularly, every month during the RSV season, usually 5 doses are required. In recent years, the resolution of the structure of the RSV F protein, with identification of potent neutralizing epitopes, and new technologies for production of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have facilitated the development of new alternative strategies for the prevention of RSV infections. One promising approach is a new generation of mAbs directed to new neutralizing epitopes and with prolonged half life. These enhanced mAbs are expected to provide adequate protection during the complete RSV season with a single intramuscular (IM) dose. The long-term goal of this approach is to provide passive immunization for the prevention of RSV lower respiratory tract infection to all infants (preterm and full term) in the first months of life before their initial exposure to RSV.

926,"Respiratory syncytial virus: Update on infection, treatment, and prevention Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, which primarily manifests as bronchiolitis or pneumonia, is the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection in infants and young children. It is associated with more than 100,000 pediatric hospitalizations each year in the United States. Infants who were premature; have chronic lung disease, congenital heart disease, or immunodeficiency disorders; or have underlying metabolic or neuromuscular disorders are at increased risk for especially severe RSV disease. Treatment of children hospitalized with RSV disease is primarily supportive, with administration of supplemental oxygen and fluid replacement therapy. Bronchodilators may benefit at least a subset of such patients. Antiviral therapy with aerosolized ribavirin is available for high-risk, severely ill patients. Handwashing, cleaning of environmental surfaces, and cohorting in hospital settings may decrease RSV transmission. In children born premature and younger than 1 year of age, and in patients with bronchopulmonary dysplasia younger than 2 years of age, passive protection against severe RSV disease may be achieved through monthly injections of anti-RSV antibody (palivizumab) during winter months.

929,"Microorganisms associated with respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia in the adult population Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has been recognized as responsible for severe respiratory illness in adults, especially in the elderly. While pneumonia is commonly observed during RSV infection, the burden and epidemiology of bacterial superinfection is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to identify microorganisms associated with RSV-positive pneumonia in adults. A retrospective study was conducted during three consecutive winters (October to April 20132016) in the University Hospital of Lyon, France. During RSV circulation periods, a systematic RSV screening was performed by reverse-transcription PCR on all respiratory samples collected from adults. Records of RSV-positive patients were subsequently analyzed to identify radiologically confirmed pneumonia cases. Bacteria were identified by standard bacteriology cultures or urinary antigen screening and classified as potentially causative of pneumonia if quantification was above the specific threshold as defined by the European Manual of Clinical Microbiology. Overall, 14,792 adult respiratory samples were screened for RSV detection by PCR. In total, 292 had a positive RSV detection (2.0%) among which 89 presented with pneumonia including 27 bacterial superinfections (9.3%) with Streptococcus pneumonia, Haemophilus influenza, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Most patients were elderly (55.6%) and patients with comorbidities (77.8%). A more severe outcome was observed for RSV-bacteria-associated pneumonia compared with RSV pneumonia: length of stay was significantly longer (16 days vs 10 days) and ICU hospitalization more frequent (66.7% vs 21.0%) (p < 0.05).

930,"Respiratory syncytial virus pneumonitis in immunocompromised adults: Clinical features and outcome Background: Though predominantly an infection of children, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) also infects adults, particularly those with immune compromise. Objectives: To define the clinical spectrum and impact of RSV pneumonitis on hospitalized, immunocompromised adults. Methods: Retrospective chart review. Clinical parameters including premorbid conditions, presentation, radiologic findings, treatment and outcome were examined in a consecutive patients series from an inpatient tertiary-care center. Eleven immunocompromised adults who had undergone bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) between January 1987 and December 1996 and who had culture-verified RSV pneumonitis were evaluated. Results: This series consisted primarily of patients undergoing chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation for lymphoma or leukemia. Two were immunosuppressed due to high-dose corticosteroids. A majority (91%) were admitted between November and May, with dyspnea and productive cough. In contrast to earlier studies, there was a paucity of upper respiratory infection symptoms (i.e. sinus congestion, sore throat) and a preponderance of lower respiratory physical exam findings (i.e. wheezing, bibasilar rales). Patients were typically hypoxemic and febrile prior to BAL. Eight demonstrated co-isolates of bacterial or fungi on BAL. The chest radiographs generally revealed diffuse patchy infiltrates, including alveolar opacities. Histology demonstrated diffuse alveolar damage, bronchiolitis with organizing pneumonia, and hyaline membrane formation. Over half required intubation, and 55% died.

931,"Respiratory syncytial virus infection in the modern era Purpose of reviewRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) continues to be a major cause of severe lower respiratory tract infection in infants, young children, and older adults. In this review, changes in the epidemiology of RSV during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are highlighted together with the role which increased molecular surveillance efforts will have in future in assessing the efficacy of vaccines and therapeutics.Recent findingsThe introduction of nonpharmaceutical intervention (NPIs) strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic between 2020 and 2022 resulted in worldwide disruption to the epidemiology of RSV infections, especially with respect to the timing and peak case rate of annual epidemics. Increased use of whole genome sequencing along with efforts to better standardize the nomenclature of RSV strains and discrimination of RSV genotypes will support increased monitoring of relevant antigenic sites in the viral glycoproteins. Several RSV vaccine candidates based on subunit, viral vectors, nucleic acid, or live attenuated virus strategies have shown efficacy in Phase 2 or 3 clinical trials with vaccines using RSVpreF protein currently the closest to approval and use in high-risk populations. Finally, the recent approval and future use of the extended half-life human monoclonal antibody Nirsevimab will also help to alleviate the morbidity and mortality burden caused by annual epidemics of RSV infections.SummaryThe ongoing expansion and wider coordination of RSV molecular surveillance efforts via whole genome sequencing will be crucial for future monitoring of the efficacy of a new generation of vaccines and therapeutics.

932,"Characteristics of respiratory syncytial virus-related apnoea in three infants Apnoea is a common sign in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections in young infants and can be the first presentation of an acquired RSV infection. We describe polysomnographic recordings of three infants revealing prolonged RSV-related apnoea before RSV infection was diagnosed. The apnoeas were of central origin. The caregivers had not noted any apparent life-threatening events (ALTE) prior to the polysomnography. Cardiorespiratory monitoring after the acute infection did not reveal any further apnoeas. Conclusion: Central, prolonged apnoea can be the first sign of an acquired RSV infection in young infants in the absence of other respiratory symptoms and without any previous observation of apnoea by the caregivers.

934,"Respiratory syncytial virus persistence in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is predominantly recognized as a pediatric pathogen although sensitive molecular diagnostic techniques have led to its more frequent detection in some adult settings. In some studies RSV has been detected just as frequently in stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients as in those suffering disease exacerbations, leading to the suggestion that RSV may persist in COPD. Although some studies have found negligible RSV in stable COPD, others have detected RSV in one-quarter to one-third of stable COPD samples. Possible reasons for this discrepancy are explored within the article. A relationship between RSV detection and increased disease severity, including rate of decline in lung function and systemic/airway inflammation, has been found on both occasions it has been sought. Susceptibility to persistent RSV infection could involve both host and viral factors. Cigarette smoking and COPD are likely to result in impaired antiviral immunity, and RSV is capable of evading immune responses by inducing skewed type 2 T-helper cell responses, antagonizing antiviral cytokines, mimicking chemokines, inhibiting apoptosis, and entering immune-privileged cells such as pulmonary neurons. It can also escape an established immune response through antigenic drift. This article examines current evidence regarding persistence of RSV in COPD and its possible mechanisms. We also discuss various roles for RSV persistence in COPD pathogenesis. Further elucidation of the contribution of persistent RSV to the pathogenesis of COPD requires interventional studies. Persistence of RSV in COPD may have direct relevance to the pathogenesis of childhood diseases such as postbronchiolitic wheeze and asthma.

935,"Exogenous surfactant supplementation in infants with respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis Infants with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis are deficient in surfactant, both in quantity and ability to reduce surface tension. New evidence suggests surfactant has a role in maintaining the patency of conducting airways, which has implications for RSV bronchiolitis. A randomized, controlled pilot study was undertaken to assess the effects of exogenous surfactant supplementation to RSV-positive infants on pulmonary mechanics, indices of gas exchange, and the phospholipid composition of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Nineteen ventilated infants (median corrected age 4 wk) received either two doses of surfactant (Survanta, 100 mg/kg) within 24 and 48 h of mechanical ventilation (n = 9), or air placebo (n = 10). Static lung compliance and resistance of infants in the placebo but not in the surfactant-treated group became progressively worse over the first 30 h following enrollment. Although no significant acute changes in gas exchange parameters were seen following surfactant, infants in the surfactant group showed a more rapid improvement in oxygenation and ventilation indices over the first 60 h of ventilation. Surfactant status was assessed from the concentration ratio in BALF of the disaturated phospholipid species dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine to that of the monounsaturated species palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine. This ratio correlated with both lung compliance (positively) and resistance (negatively), and over time increased in the treated group and declined in placebo infants. The data from this pilot study suggest that functional surfactant has a role in maintaining small airway patency as well as lung compliance in infants infected with RSV and an outcome study is now warranted.

936,"RSV and non-RSV illness hospitalization in RSV immunoprophylaxis recipients: A systematic literature review Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) immunoprophylaxis (IP) has been shown to reduce RSV hospitalization rates in high-risk infants; however, it is unclear whether RSV IP is associated with increased risk of non-RSV disease, particularly non-RSV hospitalizations. We conducted a systematic literature review to understand the occurrences of non-RSV disease and/or non-RSV hospitalizations in published studies of RSV IP. Cochrane, Embase, and PubMed databases were searched and reviewed to summarize data regarding the incidence of RSV and non-RSV respiratory disease among RSV IP recipients and controls in randomized and non-randomized studies. Independent investigators screened and selected studies for inclusion. Risk-of-bias assessment was conducted to assess strength/validity of the data using the Jadad scoring system and Downs and Black quality assessment tool, where appropriate. Twenty studies were included for review (5 randomized controlled trials [RCTs]; 15 non-randomized studies). RCTs of RSV IP demonstrated reductions in RSV hospitalizations and all-cause hospitalizations, with no increase in hospitalizations for non-RSV disease. Non-randomized studies also demonstrated reduced RSV hospitalizations in RSV IP recipients but had mixed results in assessments of hospitalizations for non-RSV disease. When RSV IP recipients and controls were more similar in disease severity risk, results of non-randomized studies aligned more closely with RCTs. Observations of increased non-RSV hospitalization rates among RSV IP recipients in some non-randomized studies could be primarily explained by differences in the clinical characteristics between RSV IP recipients and controls.

937,"Risk Factors for Severe Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection in Hospitalized Children Background: RSV often leads to hospitalization, and accurate knowledge of risk factors is crucial. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed laboratory-confirmed RSV hospitalizations regarding pregnancy factors, birth status, cigarette smoke exposure, nutrition, social conditions, clinical presentation, and severe disease defined as a need for passive oxygen therapy (pO2Tx), the presence of pneumonia, respiratory failure, intensive care unit (ICU) transfer, and prolonged hospitalization. Results: A univariate analysis included 594 children (median age 4 months) and revealed a pO2Tx relationship with age  3 months (OR = 1.56), prematurity (OR = 1.71), being born during RSV season (OR = 1.72), smoke exposure during pregnancy (both parents (OR = 2.41, father (OR = 1.8)), dyspnea (OR = 5.09), and presence of apnea (OR = 5.81). Pneumonia was associated with maternal smoke exposure (OR = 5.01), fever (OR = 3.92), dyspnea (OR = 1.62), history of aspiration (OR = 4.63), and inversely with age  3 months (OR = 0.45). Respiratory failure was associated with prematurity (OR = 3.13) and apnea (OR = 18.78), while the lower odds were associated with older age (OR = 0.57 per month) and presence of fever (OR = 0.11). ICU transfer was associated with apnea (OR = 17.18), but an inverse association was observed with age (OR = 0.54) and fever (OR = 0.11). A prolonged hospital stay was associated with prematurity (OR = 1.76), low birth weight (OR = 2.89), aspiration (OR = 4.93), and presence of fever (OR = 1.51).

938,"Prophylaxis for respiratory syncytial virus infection: A brief review Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infects about 15% to 20% of all children younger than 2 years and in the major part of cases results in mild upper respiratory tract disease with a spontaneous resolution, but in a minority (usually infants <6 months old), it causes serious respiratory tract disease. However, in some high-risk pediatric groups (preterm infants, particularly with a gestational age younger than 32 weeks, children with lung disease or affected by pulmonary or cardiac disease and in immunocompromised children), severe lower respiratory tract infection with considerable illness and death is a more frequent occurrence. Palivizumab, a genetically engineered humanized monoclonal antibody, has been shown to reduce RSV-related hospitalizations significantly, with few adverse effects. It was approved for use in high-risk children in the USA in 1998 and in Europe in 1999; it is now approved for use in more than 45 countries.

940,"Measles-mumps-rubella vaccination and respiratory syncytial virus-associated hospital contact Background: The live measles vaccine has been associated with lower non-measles mortality and admissions in low-income countries. The live measles-mumps-rubella vaccine has also been associated with lower rate of admissions with any type of infection in Danish children; the association was strongest for admissions with lower respiratory infections. Objective: To examine whether measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination was associated with reduced rate of hospital contact related to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in a high-income country. Methods: Nationwide cohort study of laboratory-confirmed RSV hospital contacts at age 14-23 months in all children born in Denmark 1997-2002 who had already received the vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (acellular), polio, and Haemophilus influenzae type b (DTaP-IPV-Hib) at the recommended ages of 3, 5, and 12 months. Results: The study included 888 RSV hospital contacts in 128,588 person years of follow up (rate 6.8/1000 person years). Having MMR as the most recent vaccine was associated with a reduced rate of RSV hospital contacts compared with having DTaP-IPV-Hib as the most recent vaccine (Incidence rate ratio (IRR), 0.75; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.63-0.89). After adjustment for potential confounders including exact age in days the IRR was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.66-0.93). The adjusted IRR was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.60-0.92) in males and 0.84 (95% CI, 0.66-1.06) in females (. P Interaction, 0.42). There was no association in the first month after MMR vaccination (adjusted IRR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.76-1.24) but the adjusted IRR was 0.70 (95% CI, 0.58-0.85) from one month after MMR vaccination. Conclusions: MMR vaccination was associated with reduced rate of hospital contacts related to laboratory-confirmed RSV infection. Further research on the association between MMR vaccination and other unrelated pathogens are warranted. (Srup S., sgs@ssi.dk; Benn C.S.; Stensballe L.G.; Aaby P.; Ravn H.)

941,"Respiratory syncytial virus entry and how to block it Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of lower respiratory tract disease in young children and elderly people. Although the virus was isolated in 1955, an effective RSV vaccine has not been developed, and the only licensed intervention is passive immunoprophylaxis of high-risk infants with a humanized monoclonal antibody. During the past 5 years, however, there has been substantial progress in our understanding of the structure and function of the RSV glycoproteins and their interactions with host cell factors that mediate entry. This period has coincided with renewed interest in developing effective interventions, including the isolation of potent monoclonal antibodies and small molecules and the design of novel vaccine candidates. In this Review, we summarize the recent findings that have begun to elucidate RSV entry mechanisms, describe progress on the development of new interventions and conclude with a perspective on gaps in our knowledge that require further investigation.

The aim of the study was to study and to compare simple infections and viral coinfections of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in hospitalized children. From September 2005 to August 2013, a prospective study was conducted on children younger than 14 years of age, admitted with respiratory infection to the Pediatric Department of the Severo Ochoa Hospital, in Spain. Specimens of nasopharyngeal aspirate were taken for virological study by using polymerase chain reaction, and clinical data were recorded. Simple RSV infections were selected and compared with double infections of RSV with rhinovirus (RV) or with human bocavirus (HBoV). In this study, 2993 episodes corresponding to 2525 children were analyzed. At least 1 virus was detected in 77% (2312) of the episodes. Single infections (599 RSV, 513 RV, and 81 HBoV) were compared with 120 RSV-RV and 60 RSV-HBoV double infections. The RSV-RV coinfections had fever (63% vs 43%; Pgt;0.001) and hypoxia (70% vs 43%; Pgt;0.001) more often than RV infections. Hypoxia was similar between single or dual infections (71%). Bronchiolitis was more frequent in the RSV simple group (Pgt;0.001). Pediatric intensive care unit admission was more common in RSV simple or RSV-RV groups than in the RV monoinfection (P=0.042). Hospitalization was longer for both RSV simple group and RSVHBoV coinfection, lasting about 1 day (4.7 vs 3.8 days; Pgt;0.001) longer than in simple HBoV infections. There were no differences in PICU admission. RSV single group was of a younger age than the other groups. Coinfections between RSV-RV and RSV-HBoV are frequent.

943,"Natural infection of pangolins with human respiratory syncytial viruses Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an enveloped non-segmented negative sense RNA virus that belongs to Orthopneumovirus genus of the Pneumoviridae family in the order Mononegavirales. The virus is the leading cause of severe respiratory disease in children under two years of age and is responsible for substantial disease burden in infants and elder people in both developed and developing countries1,2. RSV is only known to circulate among humans, though it was first isolated from chimpanzees3. The virus can experimentally infect mice, rats, cotton rats, ferrets, and hamsters, but does not naturally circulate in these animal populations4. We found that Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica) were naturally infected with RSVs that have 99.4-99.8% genomic identity with strains circulating in humans. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that five RSVs in pangolins were RSV-A ON1 and seven were RSV-B BA genotypes, both of which are currently prevalent in humans worldwide. These findings suggest that humans might transmit their viruses to endangered wildlife. (Ye R.-Z.; Xia L.-Y.; Du L.-F.; Liu J.-Y.)

944,"Respiratory syncytial virus infection and neurologic abnormalities: Retrospective cohort study Respiratory syncytial virus is a common cause of acute respiratory infection in children. Previous reports have associated respiratory syncytial virus infection and acute neurologic symptoms, including apnea and seizures. This study examined the prevalence of acute neurologic symptoms associated with respiratory syncytial virus and non-respiratory syncytial virus respiratory infections in children requiring admission to a pediatric intensive care unit. We screened all admissions over a 4-year period at a single center, identifying children between birth and 2 years of age with bronchiolitis or acute upper respiratory infection. Children with a history of prematurity, preexisting medical conditions, or prior neurologic problems were excluded. Retrospective chart review of 236 admissions was conducted, identifying the etiology of respiratory infection and the presence or absence of acute neurologic signs or symptoms. This study demonstrated a prevalence of acute neurologic signs or symptoms in 36.4% of respiratory syncytial virus-negative patients (n = 115) and 39.1% in the respiratory syncytial virus-positive group (n = 121). Apnea, the most common symptom, was observed in 19.8% of respiratory syncytial virus-positive cases and 16.5% of -negative patients. Seizures were reported in 6.6% of the positive cases and in 12.2% of the negative cohort. These differences showed no statistical significance.

The aim of this study was to quantify the viral load in nasopharyngeal aspirates of children with RSV throughout their hospitalization. This study included 37 children who were admitted with a diagnosis of RSV infection based on a positive rapid diagnostic test. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from patients every day, from admission to discharge. Viral detection and quantification were performed using quantitative real-time PCR. Of the 37 patients, RSV-A was detected in 29 and RSV-B in 6. Two patients were PCR-negative for any type of RSV. RSV-A was detected in 12 of 16 patients (75%) 6 days after admission. These patients shed detectable virus from days 1 to 12, and for a significantly longer period (mean 5.7 days) than RSV-B (mean 3.8 days) patients. Half of the RSV-A patients were also positive on day 14 following onset. RSV-A was detected in patients <12 months of age for significantly longer periods after onset than in patients 12 months of age. RSV-A viral load was negatively correlated with days from admission and days from onset. Because RSV shedding was frequently prolonged, the hospitalized children may have contracted RSV as a nosocomial infection. To prevent nosocomial RSV infections in hospital wards, healthcare workers must take appropriate infection control measures and provide adequate guidance on hand washing to the family of the patient.

947,"Cytokine gene polymorphisms moderate illness severity in infants with respiratory syncytial virus infection Illness severity and frequency of complications in infants with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection may be influenced by the local elaboration of cytokines. Cytokine gene polymorphisms moderate severity of illness in various inflammatory and infectious diseases. We performed cytokine genotyping on 77 infants hospitalized with confirmed RSV infection to determine whether specific cytokine gene polymorphisms are associated with illness severity or complications. DNA was extracted from buccal brushings and assayed for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, interferon (IFN)- interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-1 genotypes using polymerase chain reaction- sequence-specific primer technology. Clinical outcomes consisted of severity scores of lower respiratory illness, blood oxygen saturation, lengths of oxygen supplementation, and intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stays, and the presence or absence of pneumonia and otitis media. IFN- genotype was related to severity of lower respiratory illness, duration of ICU stay, and frequency of otitis media. Additionally, IL-6 genotype was related to the length of oxygen (O(2)) supplementation and hospital stay, IL-10 genotype to the frequency of pneumonia, and TGF-1 genotype to O(2) saturations at presentation. There were no associations between TNF- genotype and any of the outcome parameters. These results demonstrate that certain cytokine gene polymorphisms contribute to illness severity and complications during RSV infection in infants. If future prospective studies confirm these observations, cytokine genotyping may be a useful tool for identifying ""at risk"" infants who may benefit from the selective use of preventive or early intervention treatments for RSV.

The 999 evaluable patients in the 2000 season were comparable to the 1999 sample, except for higher rates of family allergy history and number of multiple deliveries and a lower rate of neonatal morbidity. The hospitalization rate for RSV illness was 13.4% in the 1999 season and 13.1% in the 2000 season; 10 (8%) were RSV reinfections in the 2000 season. Significant independent prognostic variables for high risk of RSV hospital admission included: lower gestational age; chronologic age <3 months at onset of the RSV season; living with school age siblings; and exposure to tobacco smoke. Conclusions. Hospitalization rates for RSV disease in nonprophylaxed preterm infants 32 weeks GA were high in Spain and comparable during two consecutive RSV seasons (13%). Readmission for a second RSV infection was also common.

949,"Progress in research on mechanism of syncytium formation of respiratory syncytial virus Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) belongs to Pneumovirus in the family of Paramyxoviridae, which is an important pathogen that can cause severe and life-threatening respiratory infections in infants, the elderly, and immunocompromised adults. The major cytopathic effect of RSV infection is membrane fusion-induced syncytium formation. Research shows that the receptor-binding and fusion-promoting activities mainly rely on two different spike structures, i.e. attachment glycoprotein(G) promoting the attachment of RST to target cells and fusion glycoprotein (F) promoting the fusion between cells or virus and cells. This paper reviews the progress in research on mechanism of syncytium formation of respiratory syncytial virus in recent years.

950,"Factors predicting life-threatening infections with respiratory syncytial virus in adult patients Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a significant cause of acute respiratory illness with a clinical spectrum ranging from self-limiting upper respiratory infection to severe lower respiratory infection in elderly persons as well as young children. However, there are limited data on risk factors for life-threatening infections that could guide the appropriate use of antiviral agents in adult patients with RSV. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study from October 2013 to September 2015. Adult patients with RSV who visited the emergency department were enrolled. Primary outcome was life-threatening infection (admission to intensive care unit, need for ventilator care or in-hospital death). Results: A total of 227 patients were analysed. Thirty-four (15%) were classified as having life-threatening infections. By logistic regression, lower respiratory infection, chronic lung disease and bacterial co-infection were independent predictors of life-threatening infections. We developed a simple clinical scoring system using these variables (lower respiratory tract infection = score 4, chronic respiratory disease = score 3, bacterial co-infection = score 3 and fever 38 C = score 2) to predict life-threatening infection. A score of >5 differentiated life-threatening RSV from non-life-threatening RSV with 82% sensitivity (95% CI, 6693) and 72% specificity (95% CI, 6578). Conclusions: The use of a clinical scoring system based on lower respiratory infection, chronic respiratory disease, bacterial co-infection and fever appears to be useful for outcome prediction and risk stratification in order to select patients who may need early antiviral therapy.

951,"Respiratory syncytial virus in preterm infants: 19 years of active epidemiological surveillance in a children's hospital Introduction. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRTI) in pediatrics. Preterm infants are at a higher risk for complications. We aimed to describe and compare the clinical and epidemiological characteristics associated with ALRTI due to RSV in preterm and term infants and to establish the predictors of fatality among preterm infants. Methods. Prospective, cross-sectional study of patients admitted due to ALRTI in the 2000-2018 period. Viral diagnosis was done by indirect immunofluorescence or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in nasopharyngeal aspirates. Clinical and epidemiological characteristics were recorded. A multiple logistic regression model established the predictors of fatality among preterm infants. Results. A total of 16 018 ALRTI cases were included; 13 545 (84.6 %) were tested; 6047 (45 %) were positive; RSV was prevalent in 81.1 % (4907), with a seasonal epidemic pattern; 14 % (686) were preterm infants. Comorbidities, perinatal respiratory history, congenital heart disease, malnutrition, chronic respiratory disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, prior hospitalization due to ALRTI, and chronic neurological disease (p < 0.001) were more common among preterm infants; they required more intensive care and a longer length of stay, and had a higher fatality rate (p < 0.01). Congenital heart disease was an independent predictor of fatality due to RSV among preterm infants (OR: 3.67 [1.25-10.8], p = 0.01). Conclusion. RSV showed an epidemic pattern and affected more preterm infants with certain comorbidities, with a higher morbidity and mortality, compared to term infants. RSV fatality among preterm infants was associated with congenital heart disease.

Study material includes routine nasopharyngeal samples obtained during 8-year period for hMPV and one single season for RSV in children hospitalized for ARTI between 0 and 15 years at the Center Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU) Saint Pierre in Brussels. Positive samples for RSV or hMPV identified by viral culture, lateral flow chromatography test for RSV or direct fluorescent assay for hMPV were selected retrospectively. Characteristics of children hospitalized for RSV or hMPV infections were compared. Children hospitalized for RSV infection were significantly younger and requiring more respiratory support, longer hospital stay and transfers in Pediatric intensive Care Units than those hospitalized for hMPV infection. Pneumonia diagnostic and antibiotics therapies were more significantly associated with hMPV infections. In conclusion, despite their genetic similarities, RSV, and hMPV present epidemiological and clinical differences in pediatric infections. Our results should be confirmed prospectively.

955,"Seasonality of Respiratory Syncytial Virus - United States, 2017-2023 In the United States, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections cause an estimated 58,000-80,000 hospitalizations among children aged <5 years (1,2) and 60,000-160,000 hospitalizations among adults aged 65 years each year (3-5). U.S. RSV epidemics typically follow seasonal patterns, peaking in December or January (6,7), but the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted RSV seasonality during 2020-2022 (8). To describe U.S. RSV seasonality during prepandemic and pandemic periods, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test results reported to the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS)* during July 2017-February 2023 were analyzed. Seasonal RSV epidemics were defined as the weeks during which the percentage of PCR test results that were positive for RSV was 3% (9). Nationally, prepandemic seasons (2017-2020) began in October, peaked in December, and ended in April. During 2020-21, the typical winter RSV epidemic did not occur. The 2021-22 season began in May, peaked in July, and ended in January. The 2022-23 season started (June) and peaked (November) later than the 2021-22 season, but earlier than prepandemic seasons. In both prepandemic and pandemic periods, epidemics began earlier in Florida and the Southeast and later in regions further north and west. With several RSV prevention products in development, ongoing monitoring of RSV circulation can guide the timing of RSV immunoprophylaxis and of clinical trials and postlicensure effectiveness studies. Although the timing of the 2022-23 season suggests that seasonal patterns are returning toward those observed in prepandemic years, clinicians should be aware that off-season RSV circulation might continue.

956,"High mortality rate associated with Bovine Respiratory Syncytial Vires (BRSV) infection in Belgian White Blue calves previously vaccinated with an inactivated BRSV vaccine In a group of 60 Belgian White Blue calves less than 8 months old still housed in barns, a bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) outbreak was revealed on the basis of a direct diagnosis (immunofluorescence and virus isolation) performed on the lungs of dead animals, and the kinetics of BRSV neutralizing antibodies. Clinical signs, macroscopical and microscopical pulmonary lesions were also compatible with a BRSV infection. This outbreak is peculiar because the 35 oldest calves (204  29 days old) had been vaccinated 3-4 months before with an inactivated BRSV vaccine and 30 % of these animals had died of respiratory distress. While they experienced a mild respiratory symptomatology, no death was recorded among the 25 youngest calves (69  29 days old) which had been left unvaccinated. Another peculiarity was found at the histological level where a massive infiltration of eosinophils was demonstrated in the pulmonary tissues of the dead animals. Together these data parallel the dramatic story described 30 years ago in children previously vaccinated with a formalin-inactivated human RSV (HRSV) vaccine upon a natural HRSV challenge. This illustrates that an immunopathological phenomenon also takes place after BRSV vaccination in cattle. (Schreiber P.; Dessy F.; Collard A.)

957,"Respiratory illness associated with influenza and respiratory syncytial virus infection Aims: To estimate excess morbidity during periods of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) activity. Methods: Retrospective analysis of a sentinel practice network database in active and non-active virus periods. Main outcome measures: clinical diagnoses of new episodes of influenza-like illness (ILI), acute bronchitis, asthma, and otitis media. Results: The clinical diagnosis of ILI was consistent with influenza virus activity and acute bronchitis with RSV. During periods of virus activity, estimates of excess morbidity in children aged 1-4 and 5-14 years diagnosed as having acute otitis media exceeded those diagnosed with each of the other three conditions; in children <1 year estimates for acute bronchitis were highest. Using a broad definition of virus activity and summarising the data for all children diagnosed with ILI, 60% was attributable to influenza (40% RSV) as were 37% of episodes diagnosed as ocute bronchitis, 9% of those with asthma and 48% of those with otitis media. Using a narrow definition, corresponding proportions were: for ILI diagnoses 77% (23% RSV), acute bronchitis 32%, asthma zero, and otitis media 45%. Acute bronchitis was diagnosed twice as frequently in association with RSV as with influenza in all age groups: excess asthma episodes were only evident in RSV active periods. Conclusions: Except in relation to ILI, RSV caused more illness than the influenza virus in the respiratory diagnoses examined, emphasising the need for RSV prevention and treatment. Influenza was not associated with excess asthma episodes.

However, in the past decade, substantial progress has been made in characterizing the structure and function of RSV components, their interactions with host surface molecules, and the host innate and adaptive immune response to infection. In addition, basic and important findings have also piqued widespread interest among researchers and pharmaceutical companies searching for effective interventions for RSV infection. A large number of promising monoclonal antibodies and inhibitors have been screened, and new vaccine candidates have been designed for clinical evaluation. In this review, we first briefly introduce the structural composition, host cell surface receptors and life cycle of RSV virions. Then, we discuss the latest findings related to the pathogenesis of RSV.

Objectives: We aimed to identify risk factors for hospitalized RSV disease and its severe outcomes. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study analyzing data of a ICD-10-code-based hospital surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI). Using univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis, we assessed age-group, gender, season, and underlying medical conditions as possible risk factors for RSV and its severe outcomes including ICU admission, application of ventilator support, and death, respectively.

Recent research has shown promise for the development of a vaccine, with a range of vaccine types now in clinical trials or preclinical development. We extend an existing mathematical model with seasonal transmission to include vaccination. We model vaccination both as a continuous process, applying the vaccine during pregnancy, and as a discrete one, using impulsive differential equations, applying pulse vaccination. We develop conditions for the stability of the disease-free equilibrium and show that this equilibrium can be destabilised under certain extreme conditions, even with 100% coverage using an (unrealistic) vaccine. Using impulsive differential equations and introducing a new quantity, the impulsive reproduction number, we showed that eradication could be acheived with 75% coverage, while 50% coverage resulted in low-level oscillations. A vaccine that targets RSV infection has the potential to significantly reduce the overall prevalence of the disease, but appropriate coverage is critical.

964,"Respiratory syncytial virus infection and palivizumab prophylaxis for high-risk infants Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) can cause serious infections in infancy and early childhood, especially during the winter in northern hemisphere temperate climate zones, and therefore also in our country. It may even lead to death in high-risk groups. Unfortunately, there is no safe and effective vaccine prophylaxis. RSV incidence in patients below two years of age hospitalized due to lower respiratory tract infection is reported as 30-38% in our country. The simple and low-cost method of RSV prophylaxis is proper hand hygiene and prevention of contact. Preventive measures include avoidance of crowds in season, avoidance of passive smoking, good hygiene control in day care centers, frequent hand washing, and application of this information and behavior in families with small children. Palivizumab, a monoclonal antibody against RSV, offers an effective and safe prophylaxis in decreasing the severity of disease and prevention of hospitalization in preterms, preterms with chronic lung disease, and infants with hemodynamically significant heart disease. It may also decrease the risk of long-term recurrent wheezing attacks. Palivizumab is applied as monthly intramuscular injections in season, but discussions are ongoing due to its high cost. The reasons to limit its use in other high-risk groups (such as immune deficiency, neuromuscular disease, Down syndrome) are lack of effect in reducing mortality, the only very recent evidence accumulation in these groups, and discussions about the high cost. Development of a new safe RSV vaccine may decrease the global incidence and severity of RSV infection. (Yalaz M.; Kultursay N., nilgunkultursay@gmail.com) Ege Universitesi Tip Fakultesi, Turkey."
965,"Manifestations and risk factors in children hospitalized with respiratory syncytial virus infection Background: Acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) is one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality in children under five years of age, and the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) remains its leading etiological factor. Although RSV infections occur in all age groups, the most severe course is observed among children. The clinical manifestations include both mild upper respiratory infections and severe infections of the lower tract, such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia that can lead to hospitalization and severe complications, including respiratory failure. Objectives: The study aimed to evaluate the manifestations of RSV infection in hospitalized children younger than 18 months of age and predictors of disease severity, as well as their comparison with the same age group hospitalized due to ALRI of different etiology. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on medical records of 448 children hospitalized due to ALRI. The analysis was performedonthe total study group and subgroups of children with positive and negative results of the nasal swab for RSV detection. In each group, clinical data, laboratory test results, and imaging results were analyzed. Results: The most common manifestation was pneumonia (n = 82; 63.08%). Otitis media was observed mainly in children under six months of age with lowered inflammatory markers (P < 0.05), conjunctivitis in those with a positive family history of allergies (P < 0.05), and pneumonia in children under six months of age, with lower blood oxygen saturation and inflammatory markers, features of acidosis, and fever-free course (P < 0.05). Respiratory failure affected 13 children (10%). However, no predictors of this complication were noted. Conclusions: As pneumonia was the most common manifestation in children with both RSV-positive and RSV-negative ALRI, it seems advisable to perform the imaging of the lungs on admission and carefully monitor the childs condition during hospitalization. In both groups, special attention should be paid to the youngest children with low inflammatory markers on hospital admission, increased clinical symptoms, and family history of allergies. Nevertheless, widely known risk factors of RSV infection itself do not reflect the risk of developing pneumonia or respiratory failure in its course.

966,"Modeling Respiratory Syncytial Virus Adult Vaccination in the United States With a Dynamic Transmission Model Background. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is shown to cause substantial morbidity, hospitalization, and mortality in infants and older adults. Population-level modeling of RSV allows to estimate the full burden of disease and the potential epidemiological impact of novel prophylactics. Methods. We modeled the RSV epidemiology in the United States across all ages using a deterministic compartmental transmission model. Population-level symptomatic RSV acute respiratory tract infection (ARI) cases were projected across different natural history scenarios with and without vaccination of adults aged 60 years. The impact of vaccine efficacy against ARIs, infectiousness and vaccine coverage on ARI incidence were assessed. The impact on medical attendance, hospitalization, complications, death, and other outcomes was also derived. Results. Without a vaccine, we project 17.522.6 million symptomatic RSV ARI cases annually in adults aged 18 years in the US, with 3.64.8 million/year occurring in adults aged 60 years. Modeling indicates that up to 2.0 million symptomatic RSV-ARI cases could be prevented annually in 60-year-olds with a hypothetical vaccine (70% vaccine efficacy against symptomatic ARI and 60% vaccine coverage) and that up to 0.69 million/year could be prevented in the nonvaccinated population, assuming 50% vaccine impact on infectiousness. Conclusions. The model provides estimated burden of RSV in the US across all age groups, with substantial burden projected specifically in older adults. Vaccination of adults aged 60 years could significantly reduce the burden of disease in this population, with additional indirect effect in adults aged <60 years due to reduced transmissibility.

Design: Prospective cohort study. Comparison of FeNO levels between infants with laboratory-confirmed acute RSV bronchiolitis and 2 control groups: healthy infants and infants with recurrent wheezing. Setting: The Department of Pediatric Emergency Medicine and the Pediatric Pulmonary Clinic of the Tel Aviv Medical Center from November 2008 to July 2009. The FeNO levels were measured at referral and at 2 visits over 4 months after convalescence. The FeNO level was measured using the multiple-breath exhalation technique. Participants: Forty-four infants with acute RSV bronchiolitis (mean [SD] age, 6.8 [7.3] months), 21 infants with recurrent wheezing (mean [SD] age, 10.8 [7.59] months), and 32 age-matched healthy controls (mean [SD] age, 6.8 [9.1] months). Follow-up data were available for 22 children (55%) for the first follow-up visit and for 11 children (25%) for the second follow-up visit. Exposure: Acute RSV bronchiolitis. Main Outcome Measures: The FeNO levels during acute RSV bronchiolitis vs controls and FeNO levels during follow-up vs acute-stage disease. Results: Mean FeNO levels for RSV-positive infants were significantly lower compared with healthy controls and infants with recurrent wheezing: mean (SD), 1.89 (1.76) parts per billion (ppb), 7.28 (4.96) ppb, and 4.86 (7.49) ppb, respectively (P<.001). The FeNO levels at the 2-and 4-month follow-up visits increased to 7.74 (5.13) ppb and 11.37 (6.29) ppb, respectively (P=.001). Conclusions: The FeNO levels are temporarily reduced during acute RSV bronchiolitis and increase during convalescence to normal levels and higher.

Although aerosolized ribavirin was licensed for RSV treatment on the basis of data demonstrating a reduced need for supplemental oxygen, ribavirin use is limited because of issues with efficacy, safety, and cost. Currently, the treatment of RSV is primarily supportive. New antiviral treatments for RSV are in the early stages of development, but it will be years until any of these may be licensed by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Palivizumab, an RSV monoclonal antibody [immunoprophylaxis (IP)], has demonstrated effectiveness in disease prevention and is the only licensed IP for RSV disease in specific high-risk pediatric populations. Although its efficacy is well established, some challenges that may interfere with its clinical use include cost, need for monthly injections, and changing policy for use by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). Preventing RSV disease would be possible through RSV vaccine development (e.g., live-attenuated, vector-based subunit, or particle-based). Alternatively, new long-acting monoclonal antibodies have demonstrated promising results in early clinical trials. Despite scientific advances, until new agents become available, palivizumab should continue to be used to reduce RSV disease burden in high-risk patients for whom it is indicated. (Domachowske J.B.)

971,"Examining the interseasonal resurgence of respiratory syncytial virus in Western Australia Background Following a relative absence in winter 2020, a large resurgence of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) detections occurred during the 2020/2021 summer in Western Australia. This seasonal shift was linked to SARS-CoV-2 public health measures. We examine the epidemiology and RSV testing of respiratory-coded admissions, and compare clinical phenotype of RSV-positive admissions between 2019 and 2020. Method At a single tertiary paediatric centre, International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition Australian Modification-coded respiratory admissions longer than 12 hours were combined with laboratory data from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2020. Data were grouped into bronchiolitis, other acute lower respiratory infection (OALRI) and wheeze, to assess RSV testing practices. For RSV-positive admissions, demographics and clinical features were compared between 2019 and 2020. Results RSV-positive admissions peaked in early summer 2020, following an absent winter season. Testing was higher in 2020: bronchiolitis, 94.8% vs 89.2% (p=0.01); OALRI, 88.6% vs 82.6% (p=0.02); and wheeze, 62.8% vs 25.5% (p<0.001). The 2020 peak month, December, contributed almost 75% of RSV-positive admissions, 2.5 times the 2019 peak. The median age in 2020 was twice that observed in 2019 (16.4 vs 8.1 months, p<0.001). The proportion of RSV-positive OALRI admissions was greater in 2020 (32.6% vs 24.9%, p=0.01). There were no clinically meaningful differences in length of stay or disease severity. Interpretation The 2020 RSV season was in summer, with a larger than expected peak. There was an increase in RSV-positive non-bronchiolitis admissions, consistent with infection in older RSV-naive children. This resurgence raises concern for regions experiencing longer and more stringent SARS-CoV-2 public health measures.

972,"Monoclonal Antibody for the Prevention of Respiratory Syncytial Virus in Infants and Children: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-analysis Importance: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of acute lower respiratory infection in children younger than 5 years; effective prevention strategies are urgently needed. Objective: To compare the efficacy and safety of monoclonal antibodies for the prevention of RSV infection in infants and children. Data Sources: In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from database inception to March 2022. Study Selection: Randomized clinical trials that enrolled infants at high risk of RSV infection to receive a monoclonal antibody or placebo were included. Keywords and extensive vocabulary related to monoclonal antibodies, RSV, and randomized clinical trials were searched. Data Extraction and Synthesis: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses reporting guideline was used. Teams of 2 reviewers independently performed literature screening, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessments, Developments, and Evaluation approach was used to rate the certainty of evidence. A random-effects model network meta-analysis was conducted using a consistency model under the frequentist framework. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcomes were all-cause mortality, RSV-related hospitalization, RSV-related infection, drug-related adverse events, intensive care unit admission, supplemental oxygen use, and mechanical ventilation use. Results: Fifteen randomized clinical trials involving 18395 participants were eligible; 14 were synthesized, with 18042 total participants (median age at study entry, 3.99 months [IQR, 3.25-6.58 months]; median proportion of males, 52.37% [IQR, 50.49%-53.85%]). Compared with placebo, with moderate- to high-certainty evidence, nirsevimab, palivizumab, and motavizumab were associated with significantly reduced RSV-related infections per 1000 participants (nirsevimab: -123 [95% CI, -138 to -100]; palivizumab: -108 [95% CI, -127 to -82]; motavizumab: -136 [95% CI, -146 to -125]) and RSV-related hospitalizations per 1000 participants (nirsevimab: -54 [95% CI, -64 to -38; palivizumab: -39 [95% CI, -48 to -28]; motavizumab: -48 [95% CI, -58 to -33]). With moderate-certainty evidence, both motavizumab and palivizumab were associated with significant reductions in intensive care unit admissions per 1000 participants (-8 [95% CI, -9 to -4] and -5 [95% CI, -7 to 0], respectively) and supplemental oxygen use per 1000 participants (-59 [95% CI, -63 to -54] and -55 [95% CI, -61 to -41], respectively), and nirsevimab was associated with significantly reduced supplemental oxygen use per 1000 participants (-59 [95% CI, -65 to -40]). No significant differences were found in all-cause mortality and drug-related adverse events. Suptavumab did not show any significant benefits for the outcomes of interest. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, motavizumab, nirsevimab, and palivizumab were associated with substantial benefits in the prevention of RSV infection, without a significant increase in adverse events compared with placebo. However, more research is needed to confirm the present conclusions, especially for safety and cost-effectiveness.

973,"Disability-adjusted life years for respiratory syncytial virus in children under 2 years BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus infection is the leading cause of bronchiolitis in Colombia. There is growing evidence about the impact of Respiratory syncytial virus on society in terms of years of life lost due to this condition. The objective of the present study is to determine the Disability-Adjusted Life Years for respiratory syncytial virus in children under 2 years in Colombia. METHODS: Data from the national epidemiological surveillance system were used to estimate DALYs, calculated from the sum of years of life lost and years lived with disability due to RSV infection in Colombia. A bootstrapped method with 10,000 iterations was used to estimate each statistical parameter using the package DALY calculator in R. RESULTS: In 2019, 260,873 years of life (CI95% 208,180-347,023) were lost due to RSV bronchiolitis in Colombian children under 2 years. The estimated rate was 20 DALYs / 1000 person-year (95% CI 16-27). CONCLUSION: This is the first report estimating the impact of RSV bronchiolitis morbidity and mortality in Colombia. The findings of the present study suggest that the actual burden and cost of bronchiolitis due to RSV is high. Prevention strategies, such as RSV vaccination, to reduce morbidity associated with RSV infection should be encouraged in our country. (Villamil J.P.S.)

974,"Modelled estimates of hospitalisations attributable to respiratory syncytial virus and influenza in Australia, 20092017 Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza are important causes of disease in children and adults. In Australia, information on the burden of RSV in adults is particularly limited. Methods: We used time series analysis to estimate respiratory, acute respiratory infection, pneumonia and influenza, and bronchiolitis hospitalisations attributable to RSV and influenza in Australia during 2009 through 2017. RSV and influenza-coded hospitalisations in <5-year-olds were used as proxies for relative weekly viral activity. Results: From 2009 to 2017, the estimated all-age average annual rates of respiratory hospitalisations attributable to RSV and seasonal influenza (excluding 2009) were 54.8 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 20.1, 88.8) and 87.8 (95% CI: 74.5, 97.7) per 100,000, respectively. The highest estimated average annual RSV-attributable respiratory hospitalisation rate per 100,000 was 464.2 (95% CI: 285.9, 641.2) in <5-year-olds. For seasonal influenza, it was 521.6 (95% CI: 420.9, 600.0) in persons aged 75 years. In 75-year-olds, modelled estimates were approximately eight and two times the coded estimates for RSV and seasonal influenza, respectively. Conclusions: RSV and influenza are major causes of hospitalisation in young children and older adults in Australia, with morbidity underestimated by hospital diagnosis codes.

975,"Incidence and severity of respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia in rural kenyan children identified through hospital surveillance Background: Although necessary for developing a rationale for vaccination, the burden of severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease in children in resource-poor settings remains poorly defined. Methods: We conducted prospective surveillance of severe and very severe pneumonia in children aged <5 years admitted from 2002 through 2007 to Kilifi district hospital in coastal Kenya. Nasal specimens were screened for RSV antigen by immunofluorescence. Incidence rates were estimated for the well-defined population. Results: Of 25,149 hospital admissions, 7359 patients (29%) had severe or very severe pneumonia, of whom 6026 (82%) were enrolled. RSV prevalence was 15% (20% among infants) and 27% during epidemics (32% among infants). The proportion of case patients aged 3 months was 65%, and the proportion aged 6 months was 43%. Average annual hospitalization rates were 293 hospitalizations per 100,000 children aged <5 years (95% confidence interval, 271-371 hospitalizations per 100,000 children aged <5 years) and 1107 hospitalizations per 100,000 infants (95% confidence interval, 1012-1211 hospitalizations per 100,000 infants). Hospital admission rates were double in the region close to the hospital. Few patients with RSV infection had life-threatening clinical features or concurrent serious illnesses, and the associated mortality was 2.2%. Conclusions: In this low-income setting, rates of hospital admission with RSV-associated pneumonia are substantial; they are comparable to estimates from the United States but considerably underestimate the burden in the full community. An effective vaccine for children aged >2 months (outside the age group of poor responders) could prevent a large portion of RSV disease. Severity data suggest that the justification for RSV vaccination will be based on the prevention of morbidity, not mortality.  2009 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America. All rights reserved.

976,"Respiratory syncytial virus infections in immunocompromised adults. The past decade has witnessed a growing appreciation of the existence, frequency, and potential lethality of community respiratory virus infections such as RSV in some subsets of immunocompromised adults. The enigmatic ""idiopathic pneumonia"" and ""pneumonia of unknown origin"" have become more fathomable. As a result, a simple upper respiratory illness in a high-risk immunocompromised adult is no longer viewed as trivial. The paramount importance of simple hygienic practices has been underscored, and contamination of high-risk immunocompromised patients with respiratory secretions is now discouraged with the same rigor as contamination with urine, feces, or blood. Likewise, the risks and benefits of administering intensive chemotherapy in the setting of a seemingly benign upper respiratory illness are now weighed heavily. The diagnosis is suspected and pursued, and the available therapies are administered promptly. Widespread efforts are now under way to elucidate the pathogenesis of these viral pneumonias and to identify the immunodeficiencies predisposing patients to serious disease. In addition, efforts are being made to develop effective diagnostic, prophylactic, and therapeutic strategies. The growing need for more effective, easier-to-administer, less costly antiviral therapy is apparent. (Whimbey E.; Ghosh S.) University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, USA."
977,"Compliance with prophylaxis for respiratory syncytial virus infection in a home setting Background. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common respiratory pathogen in infancy and childhood. Objective. To compare the compliance and biologic efficacy of a home health care agency dosing-compliance program to treatment provided in a physician's office setting during a single RSV season (November to May). Methods. AAP guidelines were used to identify neonates who were eligible for RSV prophylaxis before discharge from a neonatal intensive care unit setting. Parents were asked to choose to receive the recommended treatment for their child either in their pediatrician's office setting or through a sequence of periodic nursing visits to their home. All home health care records were reviewed for demographics, number of doses received and hospitalization rate. Pediatricians office records were surveyed by telephone interview of their office staff and parents. Compliance data were calculated based on actual monthly injections given during the RSV season. Results. We followed prospectively 1446 infants who received palivizumab during a single RSV season (November 1, 2000 through April 30,2001). Of these infants 67% (969 of 1446) received their monthly injections in the home setting where 98% of the doses were given on schedule. In contrast 477 infants (33%) received their injections in a pediatrician's office (parent's choice) with a compliance of only 89% for completion of all recommended doses (P < 0.001 vs. home setting). There were 9 RSV hospitalizations (0.93%) in the home setting group and 8 RSV hospitalizations (3.57%) in the office setting (P < 0.001). More parents indicated that the in-home prophylaxis program was more convenient than was true for those receiving treatment in the physician's office setting (P < 0.01). Conclusions. Better compliance with home injections was associated with a decrease in the hospitalization rate for RSV with a higher degree of parental satisfaction.

The goal was to establish the final supportive therapy determinants of hospital length of stay for bronchiolitis. methods. A retrospective case study of a randomly selected 25% of subjects <1 year of age who were hospitalized with bronchiolitis between April 1, 2003, and June 15, 2005 (n = 129), was performed. Records of 102 admissions to the general wards were reviewed (77 respiratory syncytial virus positive). Length of stay, pulse oxygen saturation profile, oxygen supplementation, feeding support, and nasal suction were determined. Infants admitted to the PICU (27 admissions) were excluded. results. The majority of patients presented with feeding difficulties (82% at admission). Oxygen supplementation was not indicated initially for the majority of infants (22% with mean pulse oxygen saturation of 94%). However, oxygen treatment was required by 70% of infants by 6 hours, whereas the mean pulse oxygen saturation decreased by an average of only 2%. Feeding problems were resolved for 98% of infants by 96 hours, followed by oxygen supplementation resolving with an average lag of 66 hours. The mean pulse oxygen saturation at discharge was 95%. There was no significant correlation between pulse oxygen saturation at arrival at the emergency department and subsequent oxygen requirements or length of stay. conclusions. Oxygen supplementation is the prime determinant of the length of hospitalization for infants with bronchiolitis. Infants remaining in the hospital for oxygen supplementation once feeding difficulties had resolved did not experience deterioration to the extent of needing PICU support.

979,"Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis following adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus infection Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) is responsible for nearly 10% of acute renal failure (ARF) cases in children. It is mostly drug-induced, but in a few cases viruses are involved, probably by an indirect mechanism. An immune-competent 13-month-old boy was admitted to the intensive care unit for severe ARF with anuria in a context of fever, cough, and rhinorrhea lasting 1 week. The kidney biopsy performed early brought out tubulointerstitial damage with mild infiltrate of lymphocytes, without any signs of necrosis. There were no virus inclusion bodies, no interstitial hemorrhage, and no glomerular or vascular damage. Other causes of TIN were excluded: there was no biological argument for an immunological, immune, or drug-induced cause. Adenovirus (ADV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were positive in respiratory multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in nasal aspirate but not in blood, urine, and renal tissue. The patient underwent dialysis for 10 days but the response to corticosteroid therapy was quickly observed within 48. h. The mechanism of TIN associated with virus infection is unknown. However, it may be immune-mediated to be able to link severe renal dysfunction and ADV and/or RSV invasion of the respiratory tract.

980,"Respiratory syncytial virus--the unrecognised cause of health and economic burden among young children in Australia. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) presents very similar to influenza and is the principle cause of bronchiolitis in infants and young children worldwide. Yet, there is no systematic monitoring of RSV activity in Australia. This study uses existing published data sources to estimate incidence, hospitalisation rates, and associated costs of RSV among young children in Australia. Published reports from the Laboratory Virology and Serology Reporting Scheme, a passive voluntary surveillance system, and the National Hospital Morbidity Dataset were used to estimate RSV-related age-specific hospitalisation rates in New South Wales and Australia. These estimates and national USA estimates of RSV-related hospitalisation rates were applied to Australian population data to estimate RSV incidence in Australia. Direct economic burden was estimated by applying cost estimates used to derive economic cost associated with the influenza virus. The estimated RSV-related hospitalisation rates ranged from 2.2-4.5 per 1,000 among children less than 5 years of age to 8.7-17.4 per 1,000 among infants. Incidence ranged from 110.0-226.5 per 1,000 among the under five age group to 435.0-869.0 per 1,000 among infants. The total annual direct healthcare cost was estimated to be between $24 million and $50 million. Comparison with the health burdens attributed to the influenza virus and rotavirus suggests that the disease burden caused by RSV is potentially much higher. The limitations associated with using a passive surveillance system to estimate disease burden, and the need to explore further assessments and to monitor RSV activity are discussed.

981,"Prevalence of serious bacterial infections in febrile infants with respiratory syncytial virus infection Objective. Neonates with fever generally undergo a full, invasive septic evaluation to exclude serious bacterial infection (SBI). The risk of SBI in febrile older infants and children with documented respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection has been found to be negligible. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of SBI in febrile infants who were younger than 8 weeks and had documented RSV infection and to compare the risk of SBI with control subjects who were febrile and RSV-negative. Methods. This was a retrospective cohort study of infants who were age 8 weeks or less and presented with documented fever to the emergency department at an urban children's hospital in October through April during a 4-year period. RSV-positive cases were gender- and age-matched to febrile RSV-negative control subjects. Clinical characteristics and the rate of SBI were compared between the 2 groups. Results. A total of 174 previously healthy infants with fever and a positive RSV antigen test were identified and matched with 174 previously healthy infants with fever and a negative RSV test. Infants with RSV infection were more likely to present with upper respiratory infection symptoms, increased work of breathing, and apnea. Overall, 2 patients in the RSV group had SBI (both with urinary tract infections), compared with 22 in the control group (relative risk: 0.009), 17 of which were urinary tract infections. Conclusions. The risk of SBI in febrile infants with RSV infection seems to be very low, particularly in comparison with a control group of RSV-negative infants. These data suggest that full septic evaluations are not necessary in nontoxic-appearing infants with a positive RSV test. It seems to be prudent to examine the urine in these infants, as there is a clinically relevant rate of urinary tract infection.

982,"Respiratory syncytial virus load predicts disease severity in previously healthy infants Background. Elucidating the relationship between viral load and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease severity is critical to understanding pathogenesis and predicting the utility of antivirals. Methods. Previously healthy, naturally RSV-infected infants <24 months old not treated with ribavirin, passive antibody, or corticosteroids were prospectively studied (n = 141). Viral loads were measured by fresh quantitative culture from nasal washes collected at a single time point shortly after hospitalization. Results. The subjects' mean age was 112.1 days, and the mean estimated gestational age at birth was 38.38 weeks. RSV load decreased with longer durations of symptoms before specimen collection (P = .01). Male subjects had higher RSV loads than female subjects (P = .036). Significant independent predictors of longer hospitalization were congenital anomaly (P < .0001), lower weight on admission (P = .028), and higher nasal RSV load (P = .008). A 1-log higher RSV load predicted a 0.8-day longer hospitalization. Lower weight and higher RSV load were also independently associated with respiratory failure (P < .0005 and P = .0049, respectively) and requirement for intensive care (P = .0007 and P = .0048, respectively). Conclusions. In previously healthy infants, higher RSV loads measured at capturable time points after symptom onset predict clinically relevant measures of increased disease severity.  2005 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

983,"Two-year periodicity of respiratory syncytial virus epidemics in Switzerland Background: The annual respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) epidemics vary in time and severity. The aims of this study were (1) to describe the time-related pattern of RSV epidemics in Switzerland and (2) to deduce the most effective time period for administration of prophylactic measures to high-risk patients. Patients and Methods: Descriptive study of (1) RSV hospitalizations between 1997 and 2001 at a pediatric hospital serving a population of 1 million and (2) of national RSV detection rates reported by diagnostic laboratories between 1988 and 1999. Results: 497 RSV hospitalizations and 8,574 reported RSV detections occurring during four and 12 epidemics, respectively, were analyzed. There was fixed alternation of minor and major epidemics differing in the number of RSV infections (two to fourfold), evolution (median interval from onset to peak 13 weeks, range 4-13 weeks vs 8 weeks, range 7-10 weeks; p = 0.065) and median duration (26 weeks, range 24-29 weeks vs 19.5 weeks, range 18-21 weeks; p = 0.005). For minor epidemics it was estimated that a maximum of 85.6% (range, 79.4-86.6%) of annual RSV infections could be covered by a standard five-dose regimen of the monoclonal anti-RSV antibody palivizumab, if initiated in week 50. During major epidemics the most effective time of initiation would be week 43 (88.7%; range 81.9-94.6%). Conclusion: RSV epidemiology in Switzerland is characterized by fixed biannual variation.

984,"Adolescent asthma after rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis Background and Aims Asthma risk is increased after bronchiolitis in infancy. Recent studies have suggested that the risk may be dependent on the causative virus. The aim of the study was to evaluate the asthma risk in adolescence in subjects hospitalized for rhinovirus or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis in infancy. Subjects and Methods At the median age of 16.5 years, a questionnaire was sent to 96 study subjects hospitalized for bronchiolitis at <24 months of age and since then prospectively followed-up. Sixty-seven (70%) returned the fulfilled questionnaire. RSV and rhinovirus etiology of bronchiolitis had been studied in serum and respiratory samples obtained on admission in infancy. The occurrence of asthma was compared between former bronchiolitis patients and population controls recruited for this study in adolescence. Results Doctor-diagnosed asthma was present in 30% of former bronchiolitis patients and in 5% of controls (OR 7.9, 95% CI 3.3-19.3). The respective figures for self-reported asthma were 64% and 11% (OR 14.7, 95% CI 7.2-30.0). Self-reported asthma was more common in the former rhinovirus than RSV patients (83.3% vs. 47.6%, P = 0.023, mixed infections included; 81.3% vs. 50%, P = 0.067, mixed infections excluded). Conclusions Patients hospitalized for RSV and rhinovirus bronchiolitis at <24 months of age had an increased asthma risk at 15-18 years of age compared with population controls. Within the former bronchiolitis group, the risk of self-reported asthma was higher after non-RSV versus RSV and after rhinovirus versus non-rhinovirus bronchiolitis.

985,"Bacteremia in children hospitalized with respiratory syncytial virus infection Background: The risk of bacteremia is considered low in children with acute bronchiolitis. However the rate of occult bacteremia in infants with RSV infection is not well established. The aim was to determine the actual rate and predictive factors of bacteremia in children admitted to hospital due to confirmed RSV acute respiratory illness (ARI), using both conventional culture and molecular techniques. Methods: A prospective multicenter study (GENDRES-network) was conducted between 2011-2013 in children under the age of two admitted to hospital because of an ARI. Among those RSV-positive, bacterial presence in blood was assessed using PCR for Meningococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus, in addition to conventional cultures. Results: 66 children with positive RSV respiratory illness were included. In 10.6% patients, bacterial presence was detected: H. influenzae (n = 4) and S. pneumoniae (n = 2). In those patients with bacteremia, there was a previous suspicion of bacterial superinfection and had received empirical antibiotic treatment 6 out of 7 (85.7%) patients. There were significant differences in terms of severity between children with positive bacterial PCR and those with negative results: PICU admission (100% vs. 50%, P-value = 0.015); respiratory support necessity (100% vs. 18.6%, P-value < 0.001); Wood-Downes score (mean = 8.7 vs. 4.8 points, P-value < 0.001); GENVIP scale (mean = 17 vs. 10.1, P-value < 0.001); and length of hospitalization (mean = 12.1 vs. 7.5 days, P-value = 0.007). Conclusion: Bacteremia is not frequent in infants hospitalized with RSV respiratory infection, however, it should be considered in the most severe cases.

986,"Impact of molecular point-of-care testing on clinical management and in-hospital costs of patients suspected of influenza or RSV infection: a modeling study Background: At hospital admission, patients suspected of infection with influenza or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are placed in isolation, pending the outcome of diagnostics. In a significant number, isolated care proves unnecessary. We investigated the potential impact of molecular point-of-care (POC) diagnostics on patient management and in-hospital costs. Method: Prospective collection of data on resource utilization within the hospital from consecutive patients 18 years or older presenting at our university medical center with symptoms of respiratory tract infection from December 2016 to April 2017. A cost analysis was conducted using Markov modeling comparing the actual course of events (on the basis of routine diagnostic tests) with two hypothetical scenarios: when POC would impact time to diagnosis only (scenario 1) or on discharge from the hospital, too (scenario 2). Results: A total of 283 patients were included, of whom 217 (76.7%) were admitted. Influenza and RSV were detected in 31% and 7% of the patients, respectively. Fifty-four percent of patients tested negative, of which 79% were kept in isolated care waiting for test results, with a median duration of 24 hours. Median length of stay was 6.0 days. Mean total in-hospital costs per patient were  5243. Introducing POC would lower mean costs per patient to  4904 (scenario 1) and  4206 (scenario 2). At the hospital level, this would result in a total cost reduction of  95 937 to  293 471 in a single influenza season. Conclusions: Introducing POC testing for patients presenting with symptoms of viral respiratory tract infection can reduce time-to-diagnosis, hospital stay and, thereby, in-hospital costs.

987,"Incidence and seasonality of respiratory syncytial virus hospitalisations in young children in Denmark, 2010 to 2015 For future decisions on respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-vaccination strategies and implementation into national immunisation-programmes, we used national registry data (hospitalisation, microbiology and vital statistics) to determine the age-specific incidence and direct medical costs of annual RSV-associated admissions in children < 5 years-old for the period of 20102015. We identified ca 2,500 RSV-associated hospitalisations annually amounting to total direct medi-cal-costs of ca EUR 4.1 million per year. The incidence of RSV-associated hospitalisations peaked in infants 12 months of age followed by infants 23 months of age, and infants < 1 month of age, respectively. Infant boys were at higher risk of severe RSV infection as compared to infant girls: male-to-female ratio peaked with 1.4 at four months of age and gradually levelled out with increasing age to 1.0 at 4 years of age. Five RSV-associated deaths were identified. Our findings demonstrate that in a western country as Denmark, RSV constitutes a considerable burden on childhood health. Furthermore, the best approach to reduce the high incidence of RSV-associated hospitalisations in young infants < 3 months of age may be maternal vaccination due to general challenges in achieving sufficient and protective immune responses in young infants.

Data on the risk factors for acquisition and outcomes from RSV infections in this population are limited. Methods: This cohort study (2006 to 2011) included RSV-positive immunocompromised pediatric inpatients. Nasopharyngeal swabs were tested for RSV by direct immunofluorescence. Purposeful multiple regression was used to assess risk factors associated with community-acquired RSV (CARSV) infections and their outcomes compared with nosocomial (N-RSV) infections. Means and medians were compared using Student's t test and a nonparametric test, respectively. Proportions were compared using 2 or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate. Results: There were 117 RSV-positive patients of whom 42 (35.9%) presented with (N-RSV) infection. Overall, more than a third presented with lower respiratory tract infections, which resulted in a 28% admission rate to the intensive care unit and a mortality rate of 5%; the latter solely among patients with community-acquired infection. Subjects with CA-RSV presented with more advanced clinical evidence of lower tract disease with respiratory distress (eg, intercostal recession; odds ratio 2.5; 95% confidence interval: 1.1-5.6; P = 0.03) compared with those with N-RSV. Subjects with CA-RSV infections were less likely to have a prolonged hospital admission (odds ratio 0.7; 95% confidence interval: 0.5-0.8; P < 0.0001) relative to those with N-RSV infections. Conclusions: RSV-related infections in immunocompromised children may result in poor outcomes, including mortality. Differences in mortality rates among those with CA-RSV compared with N-RSV warrant further study, with enhanced opportunities for prevention and early detection of infection.

989,"Risk factors for respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis hospitalizations in children with chronic diseases Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis is the most common lower respiratory tract disorder causing hospitalization in infants. Due to decreased hospitalization rates of premature infants following Palivizumab immune prophylaxis, the proportion of infants with chronic diseases not eligible for Palivizumab has increased. Aim: To characterize infants hospitalized during 20142018 with RSV bronchiolitis, to compare between those with and without chronic conditions, and to identify risk factors for severe disease. Methods: This retrospective study analyzed demographic and clinical data of patients younger than 2 years admitted with bronchiolitis during four consecutive RSV seasons. Results: Of 1124 hospitalizations due to RSV bronchiolitis, 244 (22%) were in infants with chronic diseases. Although 20/1124 qualified for RSV prophylaxis, only eight received immune prophylaxis. Compared to otherwise healthy infants, children with chronic diseases had longer hospitalizations, median 4.8 days (interquartile range [IQR]: 3.48.3) versus 3.7 days (IQR: 2.75.1), p <.001; and higher pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and readmission rates (9% vs. 4.5%, p =.007% and 3% vs. 1%, p =.055, respectively). Children with Down's syndrome comprised 2% of all hospitalizations, but 8% of PICU admissions; their median length of hospitalization was 10.7 days (IQR: 6.617.6). Respiratory tract malformations were present in 2% of hospitalizations, and comprised 4% of PICU admissions. Conclusion: Among infants admitted with RSV bronchiolitis, those with chronic diseases had longer hospitalizations and higher rates of transfer to the PICU. Children with multiple comorbidities, and especially those with Down's syndrome, are at particularly high risk for severe hospitalization and may benefit from RSV immune prophylaxis.

990,"Attitudes of Pregnant Women and Healthcare Professionals Toward Clinical Trials and Routine Implementation of Antenatal Vaccination Against Respiratory Syncytial Virus: A Multicenter Questionnaire Study Introduction: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common cause of infant hospitalization and mortality. With multiple vaccines in development, we aimed to determine: (1) the awareness of RSV among pregnant women and healthcare professionals (HCPs), and (2) attitudes toward clinical trials and routine implementation of antenatal RSV vaccination. Methods: Separate questionnaires for pregnant women and HCPs were distributed within 4 hospitals in South England (July 2017-January 2018). Results: Responses from 314 pregnant women and 204 HCPs (18% obstetricians, 75% midwives, 7% unknown) were analyzed. Most pregnant women (88%) and midwives (66%) had no/very little awareness of RSV, unlike obstetricians (14%). Among pregnant women, 29% and 75% would likely accept RSV vaccination as part of a trial, or if routinely recommended, respectively. Younger women (16-24 years), those of 21-30 weeks' gestation, and with experience of RSV were significantly more likely to participate in trials [odds ratio (OR): 1.42 (1.72-9.86); OR: 2.29 (1.22-4.31); OR: 9.07 (1.62-50.86), respectively]. White-British women and those of 21-30 weeks' gestation were more likely to accept routinely recommended vaccination [OR: 2.16 (1.07-4.13); OR: 2.10 (1.07-4.13)]. Obstetricians were more likely than midwives to support clinical trials [92% vs. 68%, OR: 2.50 (1.01-6.16)] and routine RSV vaccination [89% vs. 79%, OR: 4.08 (1.53-9.81)], as were those with prior knowledge of RSV, and who deemed it serious. Conclusions: RSV awareness is low among pregnant women and midwives. Education will be required to support successful implementation of routine antenatal vaccination. Research is needed to understand reasons for vaccine hesitancy among pregnant women and HCPs, particularly midwives.

991,"Effect of palivizumab prophylaxis in decreasing respiratory syncytial virus hospitalizations in premature infants Background. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of hospitalization in preterm infants and infants with chronic lung disease (CLD). Palivizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, was approved in Europe in 1999 as prophylaxis against severe RSV-related respiratory illness. No multiple season data have been published on palivizumab effectiveness in European populations. Data collected during 4 years in Spain compared RSV hospitalization rates and risk factors in a cohort of palivizumab-prophylaxed and nonprophylaxed preterm infants. Methods. The first cohort was derived from 2 previous studies and included 1583 infants followed during 2 RSV seasons (1998 to 1999, 1999 to 2000) before palivizumab initiation in Spain. The second cohort included 1919 infants who received palivizumab prophylaxis for 2 subsequent respiratory seasons (2000 to 2001, 2001 to 2002). Both cohorts were preterm (32 weeks gestational age) and 6 months old at onset of RSV season. Results. The RSV hospitalization rate in the palivizumab-prophylaxed cohort was 3.95, and it was 13.25% in nonprophylaxed infants This 70% overall difference in RSV hospitalization was observed despite the palivizumab-prophylaxed group's lower gestational ages, more severe neonatal intensive care unit respiratory courses and higher incidence of CLD. Significant risk factors for RSV hospitalization in both cohorts included: lower gestational age; chronologic age <3 months at RSV season onset; school age siblings; and lower parental education. Nonprophylaxed children had a higher risk for RSV-related hospitalization than did prophylaxed patients (odds ratio, 3.86; 95% confidence interval, 2.83 to 5.25). Conclusion. Data from this study support the effectiveness of palivizumab in significantly modifying RSV-related hospitalizations in high risk preterm infants, with and without CLD, during two respiratory seasons.

We conducted prospective viral surveillance in children <5 y of age admitted with ARI and/or fever at 2 dissimilar hospitals in Amman, Jordan during peak respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) season. We collected prospective clinical and demographic data and obtained nose/throat swabs for testing for RSV by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We obtained clinical and laboratory data for 728/743 (98%) subjects enrolled. The children's median age was 4.3 months, 58.4% were males, 87% were breastfed, 4% attended day care, 67% were exposed to smokers, 7% were admitted to the intensive care unit, and 0.7% died (n = 5). Out of 728 subjects, 467 (64%) tested positive by RT-PCR for RSV. Comparing RSV-positive with RSV-negative subjects, the RSV-positive subjects had lower median age (3.6 vs 6.4 months, p < 0.001) and fewer males (55% vs 64%, p = 0.02). RSV-positive children had higher rates of oxygen use (72% vs 42%, p < 0.001), a longer hospital stay (5 vs 4 days, p = 0.001), and higher hospital charges (US$538 vs US$431, p < 0.001) than RSV-negative children. In young hospitalized Jordanian infants, the medical and financial burden of RSV was found to be high.

993,"Respiratory syncytial virus disease severity is associated with distinct CD8(+) T-cell profiles Rationale: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes significant morbidity and mortality in infants worldwide. Although T-helper type 2 (Th2) cell pathology is implicated in severe disease, the mechanisms underlying the development of immunopathology are incompletely understood. Objectives: We aimed to identify local immune responses associated with severe RSV in infants. Our hypothesis was that disease severity would correlate with enhanced Th2 cellular responses. Methods: Nasal aspirates were collected from infants hospitalized with severe (admitted to the pediatric ICU) or moderate (maintained in the general ward) RSV disease at 5 to 9 days after enrollment. The immune response was investigated by evaluating T-lymphocyte cellularity, cytokine concentration, and viral load. Measurements and Main Results: Patients with severe disease had increased proportions of CD8 (cluster of differentiation 8)- positive T cells expressing IL-4 (Tc2) and reduced proportions of CD8(+) T cells expressing IFN (Tc1). Nasal aspirates from patients with severe disease had reduced concentrations of IL-17. Patients with greater frequencies of Tc1, CD8(+) T cells expressing IL-17 (Tc17), and CD4(+) T cells expressing IL-17 (Th17) had shorter durations of hospitalization. Conclusions: Severe RSV disease was associated with distinct T-cell profiles. Tc1, Tc17, and Th17 were associated with shorter hospital stay and may play a protective role, whereas Tc2 cells may play a previously underappreciated role in pathology.

995,"Respiratory syncytial virus infection trend is associated with meteorological factors Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infects young children and causes influenza-like illness. RSV circulation and prevalence differ among countries and climates. To better understand whether climate factors influence the seasonality of RSV in Thailand, we examined RSV data from children  5 years-old who presented with respiratory symptoms from January 2012-December 2018. From a total of 8,209 nasopharyngeal samples, 13.2% (1,082/8,209) was RSV-positive, of which 37.5% (406/1,082) were RSV-A and 36.4% (394/1,082) were RSV-B. The annual unimodal RSV activity from July-November overlaps with the rainy season. Association between meteorological data including monthly average temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, and wind speed for central Thailand and the incidence of RSV over 7-years was analyzed using Spearman's rank and partial correlation. Multivariate time-series analysis with an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model showed that RSV activity correlated positively with rainfall (r = 0.41) and relative humidity (r = 0.25), but negatively with mean temperature (r = - 0.27). The best-fitting ARIMA (1,0,0)(2,1,0)12 model suggests that peak RSV activity lags the hottest month of the year by 4 months. Our results enable possible prediction of RSV activity based on the climate and could help to anticipate the yearly upsurge of RSV in this region.

996,"Nosocomial RSV-related In-hospital Mortality in Children <5 Years: A Global Case Series Background: According to the World Health Organization, the global burden of nosocomial infections is poorly characterized as surveillance systems are lacking. Nosocomial infections occur at higher rates in low- and lower-middle-income countries (LMICs) than in high-income countries (HICs). Current global RSV burden estimates are largely based on community-acquired infection. We aimed to characterize children with nosocomial RSV-related mortality and to understand the potential impact of RSV immunization strategies. Materials: RSV GOLD is a global registry of children younger than 5 years who died with laboratory-confirmed RSV infection. We compared clinical and demographic characteristics of children with nosocomial and community-acquired RSV in-hospital mortality. Results: We included 231 nosocomial and 931 community-acquired RSV-related in-hospital from deaths from 65 countries. Age at death was similar for both groups (5.4 vs. 6 months). A higher proportion of nosocomial deaths had comorbidities (87% vs. 57%; P < 0.001) or was born preterm (46% vs. 24%; P < 0.001) than community-acquired deaths. The proportion of nosocomial deaths among all RSV deaths was lower in LMICs than in upper-middle-income countries (UMICs) and HICs (12% vs. 18% and 26%, respectively). Conclusions: This is the first global case series of children dying with nosocomial RSV infection. Future infant-targeted immunization strategies could prevent the majority of nosocomial RSV-related deaths. Although nosocomial RSV deaths are expected to occur at highest rates in LMICs, the number of reported nosocomial RSV deaths was low in these countries. Hospital-based surveillance is needed to capture the full burden of nosocomial RSV mortality in LMICs.

997,"Transcriptome assists prognosis of disease severity in respiratory syncytial virus infected infants Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes infections that range from common cold to severe lower respiratory tract infection requiring high-level medical care. Prediction of the course of disease in individual patients remains challenging at the first visit to the pediatric wards and RSV infections may rapidly progress to severe disease. In this study we investigate whether there exists a genomic signature that can accurately predict the course of RSV. We used early blood microarray transcriptome profiles from 39 hospitalized infants that were followed until recovery and of which the level of disease severity was determined retrospectively. Applying support vector machine learning on age by sex standardized transcriptomic data, an 84 gene signature was identified that discriminated hospitalized infants with eventually less severe RSV infection from infants that suffered from most severe RSV disease. This signature yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.966 using leave-one-out cross-validation on the experimental data and an AUC of 0.858 on an independent validation cohort consisting of 53 infants. A combination of the gene signature with age and sex yielded an AUC of 0.971. Thus, the presented signature may serve as the basis to develop a prognostic test to support clinical management of RSV patients. (Jong V.L.; Eijkemans M.J.)

998,"A multi-tiered time-series modelling approach to forecasting respiratory syncytial virus incidence at the local level Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of documented viral respiratory infections, and the leading cause of hospitalization, in young children. We performed a retrospective time-series analysis of all patients aged <18 years with laboratory-confirmed RSV within a network of multiple affiliated academic medical institutions. Forecasting models of weekly RSV incidence for the local community, inpatient paediatric hospital and paediatric intensive-care unit (PICU) were created. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals calculated around our models' 2-week forecasts were accurate to 93, 75 and 15 cases/week for the local community, inpatient hospital and PICU, respectively. Our results suggest that time-series models may be useful tools in forecasting the burden of RSV infection at the local and institutional levels, helping communities and institutions to optimize distribution of resources based on the changing burden and severity of illness in their respective communities.

999,"Pro- and anti-inflammatory responses in respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis is an important cause of severe respiratory disease in infants. This study aimed to characterise changes in pulmonary pro- and anti-inflammatory responses in infants with RSV bronchiolitis over the course of the illness. On the day of intubation (Day 1) and the day of extubation (Day X), nonbronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage was performed on term and preterm infants ventilated for RSV bronchiolitis and on control infants on Day 1. Tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-, soluble TNF receptor (sTNFR) and interleukin (IL)-6 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein were measured. Twenty-four infants, born at term and 23 infants born preterm with RSV bronchiolitis and 10 controls were recruited. TNF- and IL-6 mRNA and protein in infants with bronchiolitis were greater than the control group on Day 1. In preterm infants, who were ventilated for longer than term infants, TNF- and IL-6 proteins decreased between Day 1 and Day X. Concentrations of sTNFRs differed between groups on Day 1, but levels did not change between Day 1 and Day X. Large amounts of tumour necrosis factor- and interleukin-6 in the respiratory syncytial virus-infected lung suggest important roles for these cytokines in the pathogenesis of respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis. The decrease in tumour necrosis factor- and interleukin-6 protein in preterm infants may reflect the prolonged clinical course seen in these infants. (McNamara P.S., mcnamp@liv.ac.uk; Smyth R.L.)

1000,"Pulmonary function in infants with respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis OBJECTIVE: To observe the dynamics of pulmonary function in infants with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis. METHODS: The to test the pulmonary function of 31 infants with RSV bronchiolitis during acute phase at admission was tested. Pulmonary fuction test was performed for the second time among 17 out of the 31 infants during the clinical recovery phase, and performed for the third time among 10 out of the 17 infants one week after discharge. In the meantime pulmonary function test was performed in 74 healthy infants as controls. RESULTS: During the acute phase of RSV bronchiolitis, the respiratory rate (RR), peak tidal expiratory flow (PTEF), peak tidal flow/tidal volume (PF/Ve), respiratory system resistance (Rrs), and functional residual capacity per kilogram (FRC/kg) were significantly increased, while the inspiratory tidal volume (Vi), inspiratory volume per kilogram (Vi/kg), expiratory tidal volume (Ve), percent of tidal volume to peak tidal expiratory flow (%V-PF), terminal flows/peak expiratory flow (25/PF), respiratory system compliance (Crs), and respiratory system compliance per kilogram (Crs/kg) were significantly decreased as compared with those in healthy infants. Ratio of mid-expiratory to mid-inspiratory flow (ME/MI) and respiratory system time constant (Trs) showed no statistically significant differences. The tidal breathing flow-volume (TBFV) loop displayed a concave expiratory curve. During the clinical recovery phase, the above abnormal indexes showed significant improvement, except for the %V-PF, 25/PF and Crs/kg which were still lower as compared with those in healthy infants, most indexes had returned to normal. The TBFV loop showed mild decelerating expiratory limb. One week after discharge all of the indexes returned to normal. CONCLUSION: In the acute phase of RSV bronchiolitis higher resistance in small airway and obstructive ventilatory disturbance can be seen. Some of the indexes remain abnormal during the clinical recovery phase. However, the abnormalities disappear in a short time. Pulmonary function test is a valuable way for surveillance of the course and prognosis of RSV bronchiolitis. %V-PF, 25/PF, and FRC/kg are sensitive indexes.
