931,"Respiratory syncytial virus infection in the modern era Purpose of reviewRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) continues to be a major cause of severe lower respiratory tract infection in infants, young children, and older adults. In this review, changes in the epidemiology of RSV during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are highlighted together with the role which increased molecular surveillance efforts will have in future in assessing the efficacy of vaccines and therapeutics.Recent findingsThe introduction of nonpharmaceutical intervention (NPIs) strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic between 2020 and 2022 resulted in worldwide disruption to the epidemiology of RSV infections, especially with respect to the timing and peak case rate of annual epidemics. Increased use of whole genome sequencing along with efforts to better standardize the nomenclature of RSV strains and discrimination of RSV genotypes will support increased monitoring of relevant antigenic sites in the viral glycoproteins. Several RSV vaccine candidates based on subunit, viral vectors, nucleic acid, or live attenuated virus strategies have shown efficacy in Phase 2 or 3 clinical trials with vaccines using RSVpreF protein currently the closest to approval and use in high-risk populations. Finally, the recent approval and future use of the extended half-life human monoclonal antibody Nirsevimab will also help to alleviate the morbidity and mortality burden caused by annual epidemics of RSV infections.SummaryThe ongoing expansion and wider coordination of RSV molecular surveillance efforts via whole genome sequencing will be crucial for future monitoring of the efficacy of a new generation of vaccines and therapeutics.

336,"Cost determinants among adults hospitalized with respiratory syncytial virus in the United States, 20172019 Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections are common in adults, but data describing the cost of RSV-associated hospitalization are lacking due to inconsistency in diagnostic coding and incomplete case ascertainment. We evaluated costs of RSV-associated hospitalization in adult patients with laboratory-confirmed, community-onset RSV. Methods: We included adults  18 years of age admitted to three hospital systems in New York during two RSV seasons who were RSV-positive by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and had more than or equal to two acute respiratory infection symptoms or exacerbation of underlying cardiopulmonary disease. We abstracted costs from hospital finance systems or converted hospital charges to cost using cost-charge ratios. We converted cost into 2020 US dollars and extrapolated to the United States. We used a generalized linear model to determine predictors of hospitalization cost, stratified by admission to intensive care units (ICU). Results: Cost data were available for 79% (601/756) of eligible patients. The mean total cost of hospitalization was $8403 (CI(95) $7240$9741). The highest costs were those attributed to ICU services $7885 (CI(95) $5877$10,240), whereas the lowest were radiology $324 (CI(95) $275$376). Other than longer length of stay, predictors of higher cost included having chronic liver disease (odds ratio [OR] 1.38 [CI(95) 1.051.80]) for patients without ICU admission and antibiotic use (OR 1.49 [CI(95) 1.102.03]) for patients with ICU admission. The annual US cost was estimated to be $1.2 (CI(95) 0.91.4) billion. Conclusion: The economic burden of RSV hospitalization of adults  18 years of age in the United States is substantial. RSV vaccine programs may be useful in reducing this economic burden.

483,"The burden of influenza in England by age and clinical risk group: A statistical analysis to inform vaccine policy Objectives: To assess the burden of influenza by age and clinical status and use this to inform evaluations of the age and risk-based influenza vaccination policy in the United Kingdom. Methods: Weekly laboratory reports for influenza and 7 other respiratory pathogens were extracted from the national database and used in a regression model to estimate the proportion of acute respiratory illness outcomes attributable to each pathogen. Results: Influenza accounted for ~10% of the attributed respiratory admissions and deaths in hospital. Healthy children under five had the highest influenza admission rate (1.9/1000). The presence of co-morbidities increased the admission rate by 5.7 fold for 5-14 year olds (from 0.1 to 0.56/1000), the relative risk declining to 1.8 fold in 65+ year olds (from 0.46 to 0.84/1000). The majority (72%) of influenza-attributable deaths in hospital occurred in 65+ year olds with co-morbidities. Mortality in children under 15 years was low with around 12 influenza-attributable deaths in hospital per year in England the case fatality rate was substantially higher in risk than non-risk children. Infants under 6 months had the highest consultation and admission rates, around 70/1000 and 3/1000 respectively. Conclusions: Additional strategies are needed to reduce the remaining morbidity and mortality in the high-risk and elderly populations, and to protect healthy children currently not offered the benefits of vaccination.  2014 The Authors.

611,"Passive immunoprophylaxis against respiratory syncytial virus in children: Where are we now? Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) represents the main cause of acute respiratory tract infections in children worldwide and is the leading cause of hospitalization in infants. RSV infection is a self-limiting condition and does not require antibiotics. However hospitalized infants with clinical bronchiolitis often receive antibiotics for fear of bacteria coinfection, especially when chest radiography is performed due to similar radiographic appearance of infiltrate and atelectasis. This may lead to unnecessary antibiotic prescription, additional cost, and increased risk of development of resistance. Despite the considerable burden of RSV bronchiolitis, to date, only symptomatic treatment is available, and there are no commercially available vaccines. The only licensed passive immunoprophylaxis is palivizumab. The high cost of this monoclonal antibody (mAb) has led to limiting its prescription only for high-risk children: infants with chronic lung disease, congenital heart disease, neuromuscular disorders, immunodeficiencies, and extreme preterm birth. Nevertheless, it has been shown that the majority of hospitalized RSV-infected children do not fully meet the criteria for immune prophylaxis. While waiting for an effective vaccine, passive immune prophylaxis in children is mandatory. There are a growing number of RSV passive immunization candidates under development intended for RSV prevention in all infants. In this review, we describe the state-of-the-art of palivizumabs usage and summarize the clinical and preclinical trials regarding the development of mAbs with a better cost-effectiveness ratio.

873,"Infections with respiratory syncytial virus in North Lebanon-prevalence during winter 2008 Between 1 December 2007 and 31 May 2008, we analysed 120 nasopharyngeal swabs for the presence respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in 120 children aged 15 days to 6 years, hospitalized in 2 hospitals in North Lebanon. Of the 120 samples, 32 were positive (26.7%) for RSV. There was a peak in January which progressively disappeared from February to May. Being positive for RSV was significantly associated with the presence of rhinorrhoea and dyspnoea as clinical symptoms and the absence of pneumonia signs on chest X-ray and the diagnosis of bronchitises or bronchiolitis. Testing for RSV is important in cases of respiratory infections in children as it may limit unnecessary prescription of antibiotics. (Hamze M., mhamze@monzerhamze.com; Mallat H.; Lichaa E.; Zahab N.)

710,"Respiratory Syncytial Virus in Otherwise Healthy Prematurely Born Infants: A Forgotten Majority Healthy, premature infants 35 weeks' gestational age (wGA) are universally recognized to be at an increased risk of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Serious respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract infection imposes an additional burden of illness on these infants following hospitalization. Incurred morbidities relative to term infants include longer lengths of hospital stay, admission to intensive care, and need for oxygen and mechanical ventilation, all of which are associated with increased hospital costs. The highest morbidities are experienced by premature infants who are youngest (<3 months' chronological age) and are of lower gestational age. Short- and long-term follow-up indicates that healthy preterm infants both of lower gestational age and who are late preterm have obstructive lung function at baseline, which is further compromised by RSV-related infection during infancy. There is increasing evidence that childhood exposure to an episode of RSV infection may set the stage for an abnormal respiratory function trajectory, which, in adulthood, leads to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Healthy premature infants <32 wGA merit RSV prophylaxis based on existing data, whereas moderate- and high-risk preterm infants 32 to 35 wGA should be selectively and cost-effectively targeted for prophylaxis using validated risk scoring tools and country-specific thresholds for funding.

600,"Decreased lung function precedes severe respiratory syncytial virus infection and post-respiratory syncytial virus wheeze in term infants It is unknown why respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes mild disease in some children and severe disease, requiring hospitalisation, in others. We aimed to assess whether diminished premorbid lung function in healthy term infants predisposes to hospitalisation during RSV bronchiolitis, and to post-RSV wheeze. In a prospective birth cohort study of unselected term healthy children, neonatal lung function was measured before the age of 2 months (n=2133). From birth through the first year of life, respiratory symptoms were recorded in a diary, and general practitioner consultations and hospitalisations were documented. In a subgroup (n=417) repeated nose and throat swabs were collected for PCR to detect RSV infections. Median neonatal respiratory system compliance (Crs) was significantly lower (41.2 versus 47.4 mLkPa<sup>-1</sup>, p=0.03) and resistance (R rs) was higher (8.2 versus 6.3 kPas L<sup>-1</sup>, p=0.10) in hospitalised RSV patients (n=18) compared with nonhospitalised RSV-positive infants (n=84). Every 10 mLkPa<sup>-1</sup> increase in Crs was associated with 55% less post-RSV wheeze (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.35-0.90), and each kPasL<sup>-1</sup> increase in Rrs was associated with 42% more post-RSV wheeze, which was only marginally explained by pre-RSV wheeze or severity of the RSV disease. This unselected birth cohort study shows for the first time that decreased lung function at birth predisposes to severe RSV disease, and to post-RSV wheeze. Copyright ERS 2014.

137,"The cost-effectiveness of palivizumab in the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis: A systematic review Background: The cost-effectiveness of palivizumab is subject of vigorous debate. It is recognized that a policy of using palivizumab for all children who meet the licensed indication is not cost-effective, but most clinicians feel that its use is justified in certain subgroups. Objective: To systematically review the literature on the cost-effectiveness of palivizumab prophylaxis in the following subgroups: 1) preterm infants born before 32 weeks gestational age (WGA), 2) preterm infants born between 32 and 35 WGA, 3) children with chronic lung disease, and 4) children with congenital heart disease. Methods: We searched Pubmed, EMBASE and the latest versions of the DARE, NHS EED and HTA databases from inception to February 2010 using the terms cost, cost-effectiveness, respiratory syncytial virus and palivizumab. Results: Seventeen studies evaluating the cost-effectiveness of palivizumab were included. The cost-effectiveness of palivizumab for the subgroups of children born before 32 WGA, children born between 32 and 35 WGA, children with chronic lung disease (CLD), and children with congenital heart disease was studied in 8, 9, 8, and 6 studies, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios varied considerably both within and between subgroups. Sensitivity analyses showed that cost-effectiveness was mainly driven by the mortality rate due to RSV infection. Differences in hospitalization rates, industry sponsoring and study year were also associated with differences in cost-effectiveness, but these differences could be attributed to differences in mortality rates. Conclusion: The cost-effectiveness of prophylactic treatment of RSV infection with palivizumab in subgroups varies considerably, and is certainly not always below the threshold. The cost-effectiveness is mainly sensitive to mortality rates of RSV infection. This systematic review indicates that future research should focus on the major uncertainties in costeffectiveness, particularly RSV-related mortality rate.  2011 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

603,"Analytical performances of the BD VeritorTM System for the detection of respiratory syncytial virus and influenzaviruses A and B when used at bedside in the pediatric emergency department This study aims to evaluate the analytical performance of the BD VeritorTM rapid diagnostic assays (RDTs) for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenzaviruses when performed 24/7 at bedside by nurses in the pediatric emergency department (PED). The study was performed between 14/10/2015 and 19/03/2016 on nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) collected from children consulting at the PED of the University Hospital of Saint-Etienne for bronchiolitis (RSV detection) or flu-like syndrome (influenzaviruses A/B detection). NPAs were tested 24/7 at the PED with the RDT and then sent to the Infectious Agents Department for routine analyses, first by immunofluorescence assay (IFA), then by nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) considered as the gold standard in case of discrepancy between RDT and IFA results. For RSV detection, 205 NPAs was analyzed; the overall concordance between RDT and routine assays was of 97.6% (200/205). The sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), negative predictive value (NPV) and positive predictive value (PPV) were of 97.6% (160/164), 97.6% (40/41), 90.9% (40/44) and 99.4% (160/161), respectively. A total of 419 NPA was tested for influenzaviruses. For influenzavirus A, the overall concordance was of 98.8% (414/419); Se, Sp, NPV and PPV were of 100% (41/41), 98.7% (373/378), 100% (373/373) and 89.1% (41/46), respectively. For influenzavirus B, the overall concordance was of 97.9% (410/419); Se, Sp, NPV and PPV were of 96.6% (172/178), 98.8% (238/241), 97.5% (238/244) and 98.3% (172/175), respectively. Due to their excellent performances and their easy handle by non-laboratory personnel, these RDTs can be warmly recommended as point of care assays at the PED.

150,"Burden of paediatric respiratory syncytial virus disease and potential effect of different immunisation strategies: a modelling and cost-effectiveness analysis for England Background Vaccines and prophylactic antibodies against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are in development and likely to be available in the next 510 years. The most efficient way to use these products when they become available is an important consideration for public health decision makers. Methods We performed a multivariate regression analysis to estimate the burden of RSV in children younger than 5 years in England (UK), a representative high-income temperate country, and used these results to assess the potential effect of different RSV immunisation strategies (targeting vaccination for infants, or pregnant women, or prophylactic antibodies for neonates). We did a cost-effectiveness analysis for these strategies, implemented either separately or concurrently, and assessed the effect of restricting vaccination to certain months of the year. Findings We estimated that RSV is responsible for 12 primary care consultations (95% CI 119121) and 09 admissions to hospital annually per 100 children younger than 5 years (95% CI 089090), with the major burden occurring in infants younger than 6 months. The most cost-effective strategy was to selectively immunise all children born before the start of the RSV season (maximum price of 220 [95% uncertainty interval (UI) 208232] per vaccine, for an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 20 000 per quality-adjusted life-year). The maximum price per fully protected person that should be paid for the infant, newborn, and maternal strategies without seasonal restrictions was 192 (95% UI 168219), 81 (7686), and 54 (5157), respectively. Interpretation Nearly double the number of primary care consultations, and nearly five times the number of admissions to hospital occurred with RSV compared with influenza. RSV vaccine and antibody strategies are likely to be cost-effective if they can be priced below around 200 per fully protected person. A seasonal vaccination strategy is likely to provide the most direct benefits. Herd effects might render a year-round infant vaccination strategy more appealing, although it is currently unclear whether such a programme would induce herd effects.

162,"Cost-effectiveness of palivizumab in New Zealand Objective: To establish the preterm infant hospitalization risks from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in New Zealand and the net cost per hospitalization averted by palivizumab. Methods: The 437 infants born < 32 weeks' gestation in 1997 and treated at five major neonatal units were identified. Subsequent admissions during the next 2 years for bronchiolitis, pneumonia and croup were tracked, and information collected on RSV tests performed. Data on the length of stay and hospital costs were used to calculate the potential net cost per hospitalization averted associated with the use of palivizumab and the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one hospitalization. Results: Estimated RSV readmission risk before 1 year corrected age in infants <32 weeks' gestation discharged home on oxygen, and those 28 weeks' gestation, or between 29 and 31 weeks' gestation with or without chronic lung disease was 42%, 23%, 19%, 10% and 8%, respectively. The NNT with palivizumab to prevent one hospitalization ranged from six to 26 across subgroups. Mean (range) net cost per hospitalization averted was $NZ60 000 ($28 600-$166 700). In no subgroup would prophylaxis result in net cost saving. Prophylaxis for all NZ infants 28 weeks' gestation would cost approximately $1 090 000 net and prevent 29 hospitalizations annually, being equivalent to $37 000 net per hospitalization averted, with eight infants treated to prevent one hospitalization. Alternative assumptions about cost and efficacy failed to alter these findings. Conclusion: If value is placed on preventing morbidity, the priority groups for palivizumab prophylaxis are preterm infants discharged home on oxygen, followed by preterm infants of 28 weeks' gestation or less.

612,"Respiratory syncytial virus vaccine: A systematic overview with emphasis on respiratory syncytial virus subunit vaccines Objective: To explore whether RSV vaccines are efficacious in preventing respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory infection (LRI). Methods: Randomized clinical trials were sought through Medline using the following search terms: 'RSV' or 'RSV infection' and 'viral vaccine'. Randomized controlled trials in adults or children that provided data on clinical outcomes (RSV LRIs, all LRI, all RSV infections) were included. Control groups could receive placebo or another vaccine. Qualitative assessment and summary data were obtained independently by three authors and summarized on a pre-printed form. Where disagreements occurred, the studies were reviewed by all investigators. These disagreements were mainly clerical, such as misinterpretations of the table or text or transcription errors. Consensus was obtained for all studies. Summary statistics consists of relative risk (RR) and number needed to vaccinate to prevent the above outcomes. Results: Because of the outcomes examined, only studies of a purified F protein subunit (PFP) vaccine were included in the meta-analysis. These clinical trials were phase I studies to determine vaccine safety rather than efficacy. Efficacy of PFP-1 or PFP-2 vaccine were analyzed together. A statistically significant RR in overall number of RSV infections was observed RR 0.55 (95%CI, 0.35, 0.88), but the test of heterogeneity was significant raising doubts about the validity of this conclusion. The effect of vaccination on RSV LRI did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions: RSV subunit vaccines were found to reduce the overall incidence of all RSV infections. However, RSV subunit vaccines must be tested in large field trials because of concerns about the appropriateness of pooling, the risk of publication bias and the fact that the clinically important outcome of RSV LRI was not reduced.  2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

927,"Pulmonary interstitial emphysema due to respiratory syncytial virus infection Pulmonary interstitial emphysema (PIE) primarily affects premature infants on positive pressure ventilation. PIE is rarely reported in infants and children in the absence of mechanical ventilation and/or associated respiratory infection. We report a case of PIE in a 22-month-old girl who had severe respiratory distress due to respiratory syncytial virus infection. Chest computed tomography showed cystic lung lesions mimicking congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation. The cystic lesions spontaneously resolved after conservative treatment. Based on the clinical course and the chronological changes on imaging, the cystic lung lesions were diagnosed as localized persistent PIE.

571,"Infants with severe respiratory syncytial virus needed less ventilator time with nasal continuous airways pressure then invasive mechanical ventilation Aim Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) has been proposed as an early first-line support for infants with severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. We hypothesised that infants <6 months with severe RSV would require shorter ventilator support on NCPAP than invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). Methods Retrospective cohort analysis of infants admitted to two paediatric intensive care units, one primarily using NCPAP and one exclusively using IMV, between January 2008 and February 2010. Results We studied 133 (NCPAP n = 89, IMV n = 46) consecutively admitted infants. On admission, disease severity [i.e. Paediatric RISk of Mortality (PRISM) II score (NCPAP 5.1  2.8 vs. IMV 12.2  6.0, p < 0.001) and SpO (2)/F(i)O(2) ratio (NCPAP 309  81 vs. IMV 135  98, p < 0.001)] was higher in the IMV group. NCPAP remained independently associated with shorter ventilatory support (hazard ratio 2.3, 95% CI 1.1-4.7, p = 0.022) after adjusting for PRISM II score, PCO(2), SpO(2)/F(i)O(2) ratio, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and occurrence of clinically suspected secondary bacterial pneumonia. Conclusion Nasal continuous positive airway pressure was independently associated with a shorter duration of ventilatory support. Differences in baseline disease severity mandate a randomised trial before the routine use of NCPAP can be recommended.  2013 Foundation Acta Pdiatrica. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

745,"Innate immune recognition of respiratory syncytial virus infection Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of respiratory infection in infants and young children. Severe clinical manifestation of RSV infection is a bronchiolitis, which is common in infants under six months of age. Recently, RSV has been recognized as an important cause of respiratory infection in older populations with cardiovascular morbidity or immunocompromised patients. However, neither a vaccine nor an effective antiviral therapy is currently available. Moreover, the interaction between the host immune system and the RSV pathogen during an infection is not well understood. The innate immune system recognizes RSV through multiple mechanisms. The first innate immune RSV detectors are the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), and nucleotide-biding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs). The following is a review of studies associated with various PRRs that are responsible for RSV virion recognition and subsequent induction of the antiviral immune response during RSV infection.

13,"Respiratory Syncytial Virus Burden and Healthcare Utilization in United States Infants <1 Year of Age: Study of Nationally Representative Databases, 2011-2019 Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of hospitalizations in United States infants aged <1 year, but research has focused on select populations. Methods: National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample and National Emergency Department (ED) Sample data (2011-2019) were used to report RSV hospitalization (RSVH), bronchiolitis hospitalization (BH), and ED visit counts, percentage of total hospitalizations/visits, and rates per 1000 live births along with inpatient mortality, mechanical ventilation (MV), and total charges (2020 US dollars). Results: Average annual RSVH and RSV ED visits were 56 927 (range, 43 845-66 155) and 131 999 (range, 89 809-177 680), respectively. RSVH rates remained constant over time (P =. 5), whereas ED visit rates increased (P =. 004). From 2011 through 2019, Medicaid infants had the highest average rates (RSVH: 22.3 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 21.5-23.1] per 1000; ED visits: 55.9 [95% CI, 52.4-59.4] per 1000) compared to infants with private or other/unknown insurance (RSVH: P <. 0001; ED visits: P <. 0001). From 2011 through 2019, for all races and ethnicities, Medicaid infants had higher average RSVH rates (up to 7 times) compared to infants with private or other/unknown insurance. RSVH mortality remained constant over time (P =. 8), whereas MV use (2019: 13% of RSVH, P <. 0001) and mean charge during hospitalization (2019: $21 513, P <. 0001) increased. Bronchiolitis patterns were similar. Conclusions: This study highlights the importance of ensuring access to RSV preventive measures for all infants.

447,"Lumicitabine, an orally administered nucleoside analog, in infants hospitalized with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection: Safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic results Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is the leading cause of infant hospitalizations and mortality. Lumicitabine, an oral nucleoside analog was studied for the treatment of RSV. The phase 1b and phase 2b studies reported here assessed the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of lumicitabine in infants/neonates hospitalized with RSV. In the phase 1b study, infants (1 to 12 months) and neonates (<28 days) received a single-ascending or multiple-ascending doses (single loading dose [LD] then 9 maintenance doses [MD] of lumicitabine, or placebo [3:1]). In the phase 2b study, infants/children (28 days to 36 months old) received lumicitabine 40/20 mg/kg, 60/40 mg/kg LD/MD twice-daily or placebo (1:1:1) for 5 days. Safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy parameters were assessed over 28 days. Lumicitabine was associated with a dose-related increase in the incidence and severity of reversible neutropenia. Plasma levels of ALS-008112, the active nucleoside analog, were dose-proportional with comparable mean exposure levels at the highest doses in both studies. There were no significant differences between the lumicitabine groups and placebo in reducing viral load, time to viral non-detectability, and symptom resolution. No emergent resistance-associated substitutions were observed at the RSV L-gene positions of interest. In summary, lumicitabine was associated with a dose-related increase in the incidence and severity of reversible neutropenia and failed to demonstrate antiviral activity in RSV-infected hospitalized infants. This contrasts with the findings of the previous RSV-A adult challenge study where significant antiviral activity was noted, without incidence of neutropenia.

70,"Burden of respiratory syncytial virus infection in older and high-risk adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence from developed countries Background Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) significantly impacts the health of older and high-risk adults (those with comorbidities). We aimed to synthesise the evidence on RSV disease burden and RSV-related healthcare utilisation in both populations. Methods We searched Embase and MEDLINE for papers published between 2000 and 2019 reporting the burden and clinical presentation of symptomatic RSV infection and the associated healthcare utilisation in developed countries in adults aged 60 years or at high risk. We calculated pooled estimates using random-effects inverse variance-weighted meta-analysis. Results 103 out of 3429 articles met the inclusion criteria. Among older adults, RSV caused 4.66% (95% CI 3.346.48%) of symptomatic respiratory infections in annual studies and 7.80% (95% CI 5.7710.45%) in seasonal studies; RSV-related case fatality proportion (CFP) was 8.18% (95% CI 5.5411.94%). Among high-risk adults, RSV caused 7.03% (95% CI 5.189.48%) of symptomatic respiratory infections in annual studies, and 7.69% (95% CI 6.239.46%) in seasonal studies; CFP was 9.88% (95% CI 6.6614.43%). Data paucity impaired the calculation of estimates on population incidence, clinical presentation, severe outcomes and healthcare-related utilisation. Conclusions Older and high-risk adults frequently experience symptomatic RSV infection, with appreciable mortality; however, detailed data are lacking. Increased surveillance and research are needed to quantify population-based disease burden and facilitate RSV treatments and vaccine development. (Nguyen-Van-tam J.S.)

718,"Product review on the monoclonal antibody palivizumab for prevention of respiratory syncytial virus infection Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) accounts for about 20% of all respiratory infections in children below the age of 5 y. It is associated with up to 63% of all acute respiratory infections and up to 81% of all viral lower respiratory tract infections causing hospitalization in infants and young children. RSV leads to seasonal epidemics between November and April in the northern hemisphere. Most severe infections (RSV accounts for 50 to 80% of all cause bronchiolitis) affect infants younger than 6 months of age and high-risk infants including those born preterm with or without bronchopulmonary dysplasia and those with hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease up to an age of 24 months. Palivizumab, a highly potent RSV-neutralizing monoclonal antibody (Mab), has been licensed in 1998 for prophylactic use to prevent RSV associated hospitalizations in high-risk infants. This Mab is given by monthly intramuscular injection at a dose of 15 mg/kg over the RSV season (up to 5 times). Palivizumab proved to be safe and well-tolerated in this population. Concerns have been raised regarding cost-effectiveness of palivizumab and thus, palivizumab prophylaxis is mainly limited to selected high-risk infants for the first RSV season. Long-lasting Mabs will be the next future approach in the prophylaxis of RSV hospitalization until a vaccine is developed.

111,"Restricted Palivizumab Recommendations and the Impact on RSV Hospitalizations among Infants Born at > 29 Weeks of Gestational Age: An Italian Multicenter Study Objective: Premature infants have the highest risk of being hospitalized with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections. Palivizumab is the only licensed agent for RSVhospitalization (RSVH) prophylaxis in infants born at < 35 weeks of gestational age (wGA). In 2016, the Italian Drug Agency (Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco [AIFA]) has restricted the eligibility for reimbursement to infants at high risk of RSVH, ruling out palivizumab administration for infants born at > 29 wGA. The aim of the present study was to compare the incidence of RSVH in two consecutive epidemic seasons (2015-2016 vs. 2016-2017), that is, before and after the new AIFA recommendations on palivizumab eligibility. Study Design; This was a noninterventional retrospective cohort study conducted at three neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in northern Italy. Infants born at 29 and 35 wGA between March 15, 2015 and March 14, 2017 were enrolled for this study. Electronic medical charts were reviewed and parents were interviewed by telephone. Data were collected on neonatal course during NICU stay, palivizumab administration, and hospitalizations related to respiratory infections during the 1st year of life, comparing the infants born in season 1 with season 2. Results: Of 632 eligible infants, data were available for 536 (262 in season 1 and 274 in season 2). Overall, RSVH occurred 1.9 and 5.1% in infants in seasons 1 and 2, respectively (odds ratio [OR] = 2.77; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.98-7.8, p = 0.045). When the analysis was limited to patients not exposed to palivizumab, RSVHs were recorded for 1.8 and 5.9% infants in seasons 1 and 2, respectively (OR = 3.42; 95% CI: 0.96-12.20, p = 0.045). It is noteworthy that the incidence of hospital admissions for respiratory viruses other than RSV did not differ between the two seasons. Conclusion: Restricting eligibility for palivizumab reimbursement led to a significant increase in RSVH but had no impact on hospitalizations for other respiratory viruses. Future decisions on palivizumab prescription and coverage rules should be driven by a careful assessment of the cost-benefit ratio. (Priante E.; Mardegan V.; Baraldi E.)

330,"Transaminase levels reflect disease severity in children ventilated for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis Bronchiolitis, often caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), is the commonest cause of hospitalisation in infancy. Serum transaminases are sometimes raised in children with bronchiolitis. We tested the hypothesis that raised transaminases are associated with increased disease severity in children ventilated for bronchiolitis. Prospective observational cohort study of mechanically ventilated children with community-acquired RSV bronchiolitis. Alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) levels were measured daily. Children with normal transaminases were compared with those with elevated levels. Over 11 consecutive winters, 556 children with RSV bronchiolitis were mechanically ventilated - 226 had comorbidities and therefore excluded; 313 of remaining 330 were under 2 years age; 305 had early transaminase measurements. 57/305 (19%) had elevated transaminase (AST and/or ALT) levels. For the first time we show that duration of ventilation and length of admission were both significantly longer, and paediatric index of mortality and C-reactive protein higher, in those with elevated AST levels on admission (but not those with elevated ALT levels). Furthermore, transaminase elevations were transient, generally having normalised by seven days following admission. RSV bronchiolitis was more severe in children with early elevated AST levels and could be used early in the illness as a predictor for disease severity.

421,"Delayed Admissions to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit: Progression of Disease or Errors in Emergency Department Management Objectives Few studies have evaluated impact of emergency department (ED) management on delayed transfers to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Our study objectives were to describe patient characteristics of PICU transfers less than or equal to 12 hours of admission and determine the reason for transfer. Methods We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients transferred to PICU less than or equal to 12 hours of admission. We extracted patient demographics, emergency severity index category, ED, floor and PICU length of stay (LOS), and PICU ""significant"" interventions. Charts were reviewed independently by the study principal investigator and a PICU attending who classified transfers as secondary to progression of disease or error in ED management. Furthermore, errors were classified as diagnostic, management, or disposition errors. Results A total of 164 patients met inclusion criteria. Most were male (86/164, 52.4%), with emergency severity index category 2 (116/164, 70.7%) and respiratory diagnosis (98/164, 59.8%). Most transfers (136/164, 82.9%) resulted from progression of illness. No significant interventions were performed in 48.8% (80/164) of patients. Of 164 transfers, 28 (17.1%) resulted from ED error, and half of these were management errors. Compared with disease progression, the ED error group had a significantly shorter median floor LOS {3.45 [interquartile range (IQR): 2.15, 7.56] vs 6.58 (IQR: 3.70, 9.20); P = 0.005}, more PICU interventions [1.5 (IQR: 0, 4) vs 0 (IQR: 0, 2); P = 0.006], and longer PICU LOS [2.50 (IQR: 1.09, 4.25) vs 1.36 (IQR: 0.80, 2.50); P = 0.013]. Conclusions Most PICU transfers less than or equal to 12 hours after admission result from illness progression. Half of these do not require significant interventions. The PICU transfers after ED management error had significantly shorter floor LOS, longer PICU LOS, and more interventions. (Czolgosz T., thomasczolgosz@gmail.com; Kannikeswaran N.)

200,"Incidence and clinical features of hospitalization because of respiratory syncytial virus lower respiratory illness among children less than two years of age in a rural Asian setting Background. Lower respiratory illness is the leading cause of child death in the developing world. Despite this few reports on respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory illness disease burden exist from rural areas of the developing world, and none exist for Indonesia. Methods. We evaluated children living in any of 83 villages on Lombok Island, Indonesia who were 2 years of age when hospitalized for severe lower respiratory illness during 2000 and 2001. All hospitals on Lombok were included in the evaluation. We obtained the number of births and deaths that occurred within the study villages and time frame, allowing for incidence determination. Results. Of 2677 children hospitalized for severe lower respiratory illness whose RSV status was determined, 23% had a positive test; this percentage varied from 50% at the end of the rainy season to 0% shortly before the start of the rainy season. Among children 2 years of age, the confirmed and estimated incidences of severe RSV lower respiratory illness hospitalization were 10 and 14 per 1000 child-years, respectively; values for children <1 year of age were 17 and 25 per 1000 child-years. The confirmed casefatality percentage among RSV-positive cases was 1.9%; however, 84% of children who died were dead before RSV status could be determined, suggesting the actual case fatality percentage was higher. Conclusions. Lombok has a large burden of severe childhood RSV lower respiratory illness, and death occurs frequently. Novel RSV vaccines thus could have a substantial positive impact on lower respiratory illness morbidity and mortality. (Djelantik I.G.G.; Widjaya A.; Linehan M.; Moniaga V.) Prog.

304,"Estimating influenza-related sick leave in Norway: Was work absenteeism higher during the 2009 A(H1N1) pandemic compared to seasonal epidemics? The impact of influenza on work absenteeism is poorly documented. We used data from the national registry and Norway Post AS (>14,000 employees) to explore sickness absence patterns from 2005/06 through 2009/10 in Norway. Annually, an estimated 2.868% (mean 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.405-4.820%) of the working population obtained sick leave for influenza, of whom 0.915% (mean 95% CI: 0.453-1.590%) had diagnoses for other respiratory illnesses with influenza as underlying cause. In the 2009/10 pandemic season, the absence rate increased 1.5-fold, mainly due to a 73% increase in influenza-diagnosed sick leaves. At Norway Post AS, absence related to seasonal influenza accounted for 0.351% (mean 95% CI: 0.126-0.704%) of total person-days annually (excluding parental care absence), of which 32-43% were estimated to be self-certified. Medically certified sick leave increased 1.3-fold in the pandemic season to 0.458% (95% CI: 0.176-0.856), while self-certified sick leave remained at a level typical for seasonal influenza. We found a significant four-fold increase in work loss to care for sick children, 0.048% (95% CI: 0.031-0.070%) of person-days, compared with 0.012% (95% CI: 0.004-0.028%) in 2008/09. In conclusion, GP-certified and parental care work absence were higher in the pandemic season. More studies are needed to quantify the burden of self-certified sick leave.

Thousands of children infected with RSV require hospitalization each year. Consistent contact with the infant alerts the nurse to subtle signs and symptoms of RSV infection, which may include nasal congestion, cough, low-grade fever, and malaise. By developing patient and caregiver trust, the home health nurse can implement an RSV prevention plan, leading to a decrease in hospitalization episodes of premature infants with RSV.

We defined season as the period during which 10% of total PCRs performed each week were RSV positive. We identified 8 distinctive RSV seasons. On average, the season onset occurred at week 41 (mid-October) and lasted 33 weeks, through week 20 of the next year (mid-May); 97% of all RSV-positive cases occurred during the season. RSV seasons occurred 3-5 weeks earlier and lasted 6 weeks longer in RSV subgroup A-dominant years than in RSV subgroup B-dominant years. Our analysis indicates that monitoring such RSV subgroup shifts might provide better estimates for the onset of RSV transmission. PCR-based tests could be a flexible or complementary way of determining RSV seasonality in locations where RSV surveillance is less well-established, such as local hospitals throughout China.

Patients and methods: Retrospective cohort analysis of all infants hospitalized due to RSV infection between January 1, 2001 and July 31, 2005. Patients were identified by ICD-10 diagnosis of RSV infection including codes J21.0, J21.9, J12.1, J20.5 and B97.4. Medical charts were reviewed and RSV infection had to be confirmed by positive antigen detection test on nasopharyngeal aspirates. Results: A total of 464 infants had been hospitalized due to RSV infection and 42 (9.1%) were born <37 weeks of gestational age. Concurrent bacterial infections were diagnosed by either positive blood or urine cultures, stool culture, tracheal aspirates or smears in 4 of 42 preterm (9.5%) compared to 13 of 422 term (3.1%) infants (p = 0.017, RR 3.092, CI 95% 1.251-7.641). Excluding the infants admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) the total rate of bacterial co-infection was 1.9%.

This study was to establish a model to explore anti- RSV effect of different administration method of Chinese medicine realgar on respiratory syncytial virus type A (RSV-A) replication in Hep-2 cells. Using high-energy ball milling with distilled water to prepare realgar nanoparticles,the concentration of nanometer realgar was tested by molybdenum blue staining method and the size of realgar nanoparticles was tested on Nano Series. Cell culture with ribavirin as a positive control was applied to observe the effect of anti-respiratory syncytial virus type A replication through prevention, treatment or direct inactivation of three different drug administration methods. Realgar nano-particles was found to be a potential inhibitor of RSV-A in a concentration-dependent manner with the median toxic concentration(TC50) of 0.649 microg/mL in Hep-2 cell culture. The median inhibition concentration (IC50) was 0.20 microg/mL when drug was added before virus infection. The IC50 was 0.13 microg/mL when drug was added after virus infection,and it was 0.16 microg/mL when the drug was mixed with virus and added. The therapeutic index (TI) was 3.18, 4.99 and 4.11, respectively. The results showed realgar nanoparticles could inhibit the replication of the RSV and inactivate the RSV in vitro. (Cheng M.)

430,"An evaluation of the emerging interventions against Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)-associated acute lower respiratory infections in children. Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is the leading cause of acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) in children. It is estimated to cause approximately 33.8 million new episodes of ALRI in children annually, 96% of these occurring in developing countries. It is also estimated to result in about 53,000 to 199,000 deaths annually in young children. Currently there are several vaccine and immunoprophylaxis candidates against RSV in the developmental phase targeting active and passive immunization. We used a modified CHNRI methodology for setting priorities in health research investments. This was done in two stages. In Stage I, we systematically reviewed the literature related to emerging vaccines against RSV relevant to 12 criteria of interest. In Stage II, we conducted an expert opinion exercise by inviting 20 experts (leading basic scientists, international public health researchers, international policy makers and representatives of pharmaceutical companies). The policy makers and industry representatives accepted our invitation on the condition of anonymity, due to the sensitive nature of their involvement in such exercises. They answered questions from the CHNRI framework and their ""collective optimism"" towards each criterion was documented on a scale from 0 to 100%. In the case of candidate vaccines for active immunization of infants against RSV, the experts expressed very low levels of optimism for low product cost, affordability and low cost of development; moderate levels of optimism regarding the criteria of answerability, likelihood of efficacy, deliverability, sustainability and acceptance to end users for the interventions; and high levels of optimism regarding impact on equity and acceptance to health workers. While considering the candidate vaccines targeting pregnant women, the panel expressed low levels of optimism for low product cost, affordability, answerability and low development cost; moderate levels of optimism for likelihood of efficacy, deliverability, sustainability and impact on equity; high levels of optimism regarding acceptance to end users and health workers. The group also evaluated immunoprophylaxis against RSV using monoclonal antibodies and expressed no optimism towards low product cost; very low levels of optimism regarding deliverability, affordability, sustainability, low implementation cost and impact on equity; moderate levels of optimism against the criteria of answerability, likelihood of efficacy, acceptance to end-users and health workers; and high levels of optimism regarding low development cost. They felt that either of these vaccines would have a high impact on reducing burden of childhood ALRI due to RSV and reduce the overall childhood ALRI burden by a maximum of about 10%. Although monoclonal antibodies have proven to be effective in providing protection to high-risk infants, their introduction in resource poor settings might be limited by high cost associated with them. Candidate vaccines for active immunization of infants against RSV hold greatest promise. Introduction of a low cost vaccine against RSV would reduce the inequitable distribution of burden due to childhood ALRI and will most likely have a high impact on morbidity and mortality due to severe ALRI.

883,"Pathogenesis of respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis-related wheezing Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common cause of virus infection of the human respiratory tract during the first two years of life, with virtually all children experiencing at least one infection within this period. Although this usually leads to mild respiratory illness, some infants develop more severe disease (bronchiolitis, pneumonia, etc.) affecting the lower airways and frequently requiring hospitalisation. There is evidence that bronchiolitis hospitalisations have increased during the last two decades and many of the hospitalised children develop wheezing later in life. The immune response to the virus is probably a major factor in the development or the expression of the pathological phenotype. In particular, a bias towards type-2 cytokine responses seems to be associated with more severe disease, whereas a type-1 response leads to more effective viral clearance and milder illness. Although the virus by itself triggers a type-1 response, a preexisting type-1 deficiency may contribute to the severity of the disease. In that sense, RSV bronchiolitis may serve as a marker, reflecting predisposition of the individual for virus induced wheezing early in life and/or asthma later in life.  2004 Elsevier Scince Ltd.

We conducted this retrospective study to evaluate clinical outcomes and mortality rates of RSV-infected hematologic malignancy patients from 2007 to 2016. A total of 67 patients (19 received palivizumab and 47 received supportive care) were identified. Palivizumab-treated patients had a significantly higher proportion of underlying ischemic heart disease, graft-versus-host-disease, hypogammaglobulinemia, and concomitant pulmonary infections. There were no significant differences in mortality rates or readmission rates between the two groups. The estimated odds ratio for death in patients receiving palivizumab after adjusting for propensity scores and covariates were 0.12 ([0.01, 1.32], p =.08) and 0.09 ([0.01, 1.03], p =.05) respectively. After adjustment for factors associated with severity of illness, there was no difference in mortality among patients treated with palivizumab.

540,"Non-Typhi, non-Paratyphi Salmonella-related hospitalisations in Spain: trends, clinical aspects, risk factors for worse prognosis and hospital costs This study reviews non-typhoid Salmonella (NTS)-related hospitalisations at National level in Spain between 2010 and 2015. NTS hospitalisations were obtained from the National Registry of Hospitalisations. A descriptive analysis of the hospitalisations was performed, including hospitalisation rates (HR) and case-fatality rates (CFR%) calculation. For those with NTS as Main Diagnosis logistic regression were used to estimate the relationship between the different factors and death outcome. 21,660 registered NTS-related hospitalisations were described (88.8% with Salmonella coded as Main Diagnosis). Average HR(20102015) was 7.7 (range, 7.3 to 8.1) hospitalisations/100,000 population. Those with NTS infections as Secondary Diagnosis were on average (p < 0.001) older (47.9 vs. 36.5 years), presented worse Charlson Comorbidity Index (2.1 vs. 1.2), higher CFR% (4.8% vs. 0.7%), spent more days hospitalised (15.1 vs. 5.8 days), and generated more costs (6173 vs. 4272 euros/per hospitalisation) than those with NTS as Main Diagnosis. For those with NTS as Main Diagnosis increased risk of death was related to being > 64 years old (OR = 20.99; p < 0.001); presenting septicaemia (OR = 15.82; p < 0.001) or localised infections (OR = 3.98; p = 0.061); Charlson Comorbidity Index > 3 (OR = 4.57; p < 0.001); a non-HIV co-infection (OR = 1.80; p = 0.013); other risk factors (OR = 5.70; p < 0.001); bowel perforation (OR = 70.30; p < 0.001); or acute renal failure (OR = 1.95; p = 0.001). In those with Salmonella as Main Diagnosis, among all complications, bowel perforation presented the strongest association with death outcome.

654,"Respiratory syncytial virus infection in children Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an RNA virus that causes respiratory tract infections in children. In the Northern Hemisphere, the peak infection season is November through April. By two years of age, most children will have had an RSV infection. Bronchiolitis, a lower respiratory tract infection, is often caused by RSV. An RSV infection is diagnosed based on patient history and physical examination. Children typically present with cough, coryza, and wheezing. Laboratory testing and chest radiography are not necessary to make the diagnosis. Serious concurrent bacterial infections are rare. Treatment of an RSV infection is supportive, with particular attention to maintaining hydration and oxygenation. Children younger than 60 days and those with severe symptoms may require hospitalization. Neither antibiotics nor corticosteroids are helpful for bronchiolitis. A bronchodilator trial is appropriate for children with wheezing, but should not be continued unless there is a prompt favorable response. Frequent hand washing and contact isolation may prevent the spread of RSV infections. Children younger than two years at high risk of severe illness, including those born before 35 weeks of gestation and those with chronic lung or cardiac problems, may be candidates for palivizumab prophylaxis for RSV infection during the peak infection season.

The major cytopathic effect of RSV infection is membrane fusion-induced syncytium formation. Research shows that the receptor-binding and fusion-promoting activities mainly rely on two different spike structures, i.e. attachment glycoprotein(G) promoting the attachment of RST to target cells and fusion glycoprotein (F) promoting the fusion between cells or virus and cells.

80,"Using Google Trends to Predict Pediatric Respiratory Syncytial Virus Encounters at a Major Health Care System To assess whether Google search activity predicts lead-time for pediatric respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) encounters within a major health care system. Internet user search and health system encounter database analysis. Pediatric RSV encounter volumes across all clinics and hospitals in the Duke Health system were tabulated from 2005 to 2016. North Carolina Google user search activity for RSV were obtained over the same time period. Time series analysis was used to compare RSV encounters and search activity. Cross-correlation was used to determine the lag time difference between Google user search interest for RSV and observed Pediatric RSV encounter volumes. Google search activity and Pediatric RSV encounter volumes demonstrated strong seasonality with predilection for winter months. Granger Causality testing revealed that North Carolina RSV Google search activity can predict pediatric RSV encounters at our health system (F = 5.72, p < 0.0001). Using cross-correlation, increases in Google search activity provided lead time of 0.21 weeks (1.47 days) prior to observed increases in Pediatric RSV encounter volumes at our health system. RSV is a common cause of upper airway obstruction in pediatric patients for which pediatric otolaryngologists are consulted. We demonstrate that Google search activity can predict RSV patient interactions with a major health system with a measurable lead-time. The ability to predict when illnesses in a population result in increased health care utilization would be an asset to health system providers, planners and administrators. Prediction of RSV would allow specific care pathways to be developed and resource needs to be anticipated before actual presentation. (Crowson M.G., matt.crowson@mail.utoronto.ca; Eskander A.)

501,"Sepsis predisposition in children with human immunodeficiency virus Objective: To review predisposition to sepsis in children infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Design: Summary of the literature with review by experts in the field. Results: In industrialized regions, new diagnoses of vertically acquired HIV infection are falling due to perinatal interventions. Provision of HAART has resulted in an enlarging cohort of clinically stable HIV-infected children, with low viral loads and normal CD4 T-lymphocyte counts. Access to HAART in ""developed"" countries has markedly decreased the rate of progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, the prevalence of organ-specific complications of HIV, the risk of recurrent sepsis, and the high early childhood mortality from HIV infection. There are currently no data on whether initiation of HAART during acute sepsis reduces short-term morbidity or mortality. Undiagnosed, antiretroviral-naive, HIV-infected infants still present sporadically with opportunistic infections such as Pneumocystis jiroveci and cytomegalovirus pneumonia. HIV-infected children have a greater burden of disease due to viral, bacterial, and fungal sepsis, and the case fatality rate for nonopportunistic infections may be greater than in non-HIV-infected children. In ""developing"" countries, with limited access to HAART, the natural history of HIV infection has altered very little, with the majority of infected children dying from either opportunistic or nonopportunistic disease before 3 yrs of age. Conclusion: Pediatric HIV infection is not a homogeneous condition in the era of HAART. Susceptibility to sepsis, morbidity, and mortality differ according to stage of disease, access to HAART, and virologic and immunologic response to treatment. These issues should be considered if HIV-infected children are to be enrolled and stratified in clinical trials.

Design: a retrospective study. Setting: The paediatric intensive care units of two tertiary care centres. Subjects: Forty one former premature (<36 weeks) infants requiring mechanical ventilation (MV) for documented RSV infection (by either Elisa and/ or culture). Intervention: Twenty-one patients received 16 h of aerosolised ribavirin for 3 days (group A) and 20 infants did not receive any ribavirin (group B). Measurements: The groups were compared for age, sex, weight, gestational age, incidence of apnoea, blood gas analysis, alveolar-arterial gradients, PaO(2), PaCO(2), and underlying pulmonary disease. Outcome variables included paediatric risk of mortality (PRISM) score, days of mechanical ventilation (MV), ICU days, hospital length of stay, and mortality. The data were analysed using the student t-test, chisquare and logistic regression. Results: There was no difference between the two study groups in age, sex, birth weight, gestational age, underlying pulmonary disease, incidence of apnoea, or blood gas analysis. There was no difference in PRISM score (6.1 vs. 6.5, p = 0.60), days of MV (5.3 vs. 6.9, p = 0.37), ICU length of stay (7.1 vs 7.7, p = 0.71) and hospital length of stay (10.3 vs. 12.3, p = 0.30). There were no deaths in group A and two deaths in group B (Fisher Exact Test, p = 0.23) suggesting no significant relationship between the use of ribavirin and death.

413,"Evaluation of a standardised protocol to measure the disease burden of respiratory syncytial virus infection in young children in primary care Background: A better understanding of the burden of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections in primary care is needed for policymakers to make informed decisions regarding new preventive measures and treatments. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a protocol for the standardised measurement of the disease burden of RSV infection in primary care in children aged < 5 years. Methods: The standardised protocol was evaluated in Italy and the Netherlands during the 2019/20 winter. Children aged < 5 years who consulted their primary care physician, met the WHO acute respiratory infections (ARI) case definition, and had a laboratory confirmed positive test for RSV (RT-PCR) were included. RSV symptoms were collected at the time of swabbing. Health care use, duration of symptoms and socio-economic impact was measured 14 days after swabbing. Health related Quality of life (HRQoL) was measured using the parent-proxy report of the PedsQLTM4.0 generic core scales (24 years) and PedsQLTM4.0 infant scales (02 years) 30 days after swabbing. The standardised protocol was evaluated in terms of the feasibility of patient recruitment, data collection procedures and whether parents understood the questions. Results: Children were recruited via a network of paediatricians in Italy and a sentinel influenza surveillance network of general practitioners in the Netherlands. In Italy and the Netherlands, 293 and 152 children were swabbed respectively, 119 and 32 tested RSV positive; for 119 and 12 children the Day-14 questionnaire was completed and for 116 and 11 the Day-30 questionnaire. In Italy, 33% of the children had persistent symptoms after 14 days and in the Netherlands this figure was 67%. Parents had no problems completing questions concerning health care use, duration of symptoms and socio-economic impact, however, they had some difficulties scoring the HRQoL of their young children. Conclusion: RSV symptoms are common after 14 days, and therefore, measuring disease burden outcomes like health care use, duration of symptoms, and socio-economic impact is also recommended at Day-30. The standardised protocol is suitable to measure the clinical and socio-economic disease burden of RSV in young children in primary care.

181,"Global burden of acute lower respiratory infections due to respiratory syncytial virus in young children: a systematic review and meta-analysis Background: The global burden of disease attributable to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) remains unknown. We aimed to estimate the global incidence of and mortality from episodes of acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) due to RSV in children younger than 5 years in 2005. Methods: We estimated the incidence of RSV-associated ALRI in children younger than 5 years, stratified by age, using data from a systematic review of studies published between January, 1995, and June, 2009, and ten unpublished population-based studies. We estimated possible boundaries for RSV-associated ALRI mortality by combining case fatality ratios with incidence estimates from hospital-based reports from published and unpublished studies and identifying studies with population-based data for RSV seasonality and monthly ALRI mortality. Findings: In 2005, an estimated 338 (95% CI 193-462) million new episodes of RSV-associated ALRI occurred worldwide in children younger than 5 years (22% of ALRI episodes), with at least 34 (28-43) million episodes representing severe RSV-associated ALRI necessitating hospital admission. We estimated that 66 000-199 000 children younger than 5 years died from RSV-associated ALRI in 2005, with 99% of these deaths occurring in developing countries. Incidence and mortality can vary substantially from year to year in any one setting. Interpretation: Globally, RSV is the most common cause of childhood ALRI and a major cause of admission to hospital as a result of severe ALRI. Mortality data suggest that RSV is an important cause of death in childhood from ALRI, after pneumococcal pneumonia and Haemophilus influenzae type b.

390,"Antigenic Fingerprinting of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)-A-Infected Hematopoietic Cell Transplant Recipients Reveals Importance of Mucosal Anti-RSV G Antibodies in Control of RSV Infection in Humans Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection causes significant morbidity in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. However, antibody responses that correlate with recovery from RSV disease are not fully understood. Methods: In this study, antibody repertoire in paired serum and nasal wash samples from acutely RSV-A-infected HCT recipients who recovered early (<14 days of RSV shedding) were compared with late-recovered patients (14 days of shedding) using gene fragment phage display libraries and surface plasmon resonance. Results: Anti-F serum responses were similar between these 2 groups for antibody repertoires, neutralization titers, anti-F binding antibodies (prefusion and postfusion proteins), antibody avidity, and binding to specific antigenic sites. In contrast, nasal washes from early-recovered individuals demonstrated higher binding to F peptide containing p27. While the serum RSV G antibody repertoires in the 2 groups were similar, the strongest difference between early-recovered and late-recovered patients was observed in the titers of nasal wash antibodies, especially binding to the central conserved domain. Most importantly, a significantly higher antibody affinity to RSV G was observed in nasal washes from early-recovered individuals compared with late-recovered HCT recipients. Conclusions: These findings highlight the importance of mucosal antibodies in resolution of RSV-A infection in the upper respiratory tract.

19,"A cost-benefit analysis of the immunisation of children against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) using the English Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common cause of respiratory infection that is highly prevalent in infants, particularly those with underlying medical conditions. Severe cases of RSV require hospitalisation as well as admission to intensive care and may even result in death. The objective of the study was to measure the net benefits that could arise from an immunisation programme of infants that may well eradicate RSV to a high degree and save the direct and indirect medical care costs from hospitalisation, morbidity and the gain from potential life-time earnings by reducing the probability of mortality. In this context, the majority of existing empirical investigations are based on data from clinical trials, and where relevant facts are not available, a series of strong assumptions is derived from the published literature, whereas in this study, for the first time, the hospital episode statistics database is used to calculate the cost-benefit ratios. The methodology of the analysis adopts a cost-benefit approach to assess the impact of the immunisation and whether it is beneficial to society. The underlying assumptions of the basic model are assessed by adopting a sensitivity analysis. The results show that a number of categories are cost-effective with the use of the passive drug, which means benefits by raising the life expectancy and quality as well as reducing the resource burden on society.

156,"Cost-effectiveness of strategies for preventing paediatric lower respiratory infections associated with respiratory syncytial virus in eight Chinese cities Background: New monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and vaccines against RSV with promising efficacy and protection duration are expected to be available in the near future. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of the administration of maternal immunisation (MI), infant mAb (IA) and paediatric immunisation (PI) as well as their combinations in eight Chinese cities. Methods: We used a static model to estimate the impact of these preventive interventions on reducing the burden of RSV-ALRI in twelve monthly birth cohorts from a societal perspective. In addition to year-round administration, we also considered seasonal administration of MI and IA (i.e., administered only to children born in selected months). The primary outcome was threshold strategy cost (TSC), defined as the maximum costs per child for a strategy to be cost-effective. Results: With a willingness-to-pay threshold of one national GDP per capita per QALY gained for all the cities, TSC of year-round strategies was: (i) US$2.4 (95% CI: 1.9-3.4) to US$14.7 (11.6-21.4) for MI; (ii) US$19.9 (16.9-25.9) to US$144.2 (124.6-184.7) for IA; (iii) US$28.7 (22.0-42.0) to US$201.0 (156.5-298.6) for PI; (iv) US$31.1 (24.0-45.5) to US$220.7 (172.0-327.3) for maternal plus paediatric immunisation (MPI); and (v) US$41.3 (32.6-58.9) to US$306.2 (244.1-441.3) for infant mAb plus paediatric immunisation (AP). In all cities, the top ten seasonal strategies (ranked by TSC) protected infants from 5 or fewer monthly birth cohorts. Conclusions: Administration of these interventions could be cost-effective if they are suitably priced. Suitably-timed seasonal administration could be more cost-effective than their year-round counterpart. Our results can inform the optimal strategy once these preventive interventions are commercially available.

The purpose of this observational study was to determine the frequency, seasonality, morbidity, and mortality of RSV infection in a group of cancer patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy with neither ribavirin nor IVIG treatment. During the period of October 3, 1997, through October 14, 1998, 190 cancer patients (median age, 58 years; 71 women) underwent viral nasopharyngeal washing prior to chemotherapy. Multiple myeloma (MM) accounted for most patients (147, 77%). RSV was recovered from cultures taken from 71 patients (37%) throughout the year, although more frequently during fall and winter seasons (P < .001) than spring and summer. Serious respiratory complications developed in 19 (27%) of 71 RSV-positive patients versus 24 (20%) of 119 patients whose RSV cultures were negative (P = .384). The presence of renal failure or increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) prior to chemotherapy and the development of mucositis were the only predictive factors for severe respiratory complications. Recovery of RSV from nasopharyngeal washings among cancer patients is common, occurs throughout the year, and does not appear to increase serious morbidity or mortality. RSV infection may not necessarily be a contraindication for APBSCT or an indication for therapy with aerosolized ribavirin and IVIG.  2004 by The American Society of Hematology.

299,"Inhaled prostacyclin and high-frequency oscillatory ventilation in a premature infant with respiratory syncytial virus-associated respiratory failure In a 29-day-old premature infant with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) pneumonia, we have shown an additive effect of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) and continuous inhalation of prostacyclin (iPGI2) with improvement of ventilation and oxygenation. The addition of continuous inhaled iPGI2 to HFOV was beneficial in the treatment of hypoxemic respiratory failure owing to RSV-associated pneumonia. The improvement in alveolar recruitment by increasing lung expansion by HFOV along with less ventilation-perfusion mismatch by iPGI2 appears to be responsible for the synergistic effect and favorable clinical outcome. We conclude that the combined therapy of HFOV and continuous inhaled iPGI2 may be considered in RSV-associated hypoxemic respiratory failure in pediatric patients.

537,"Complications in infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis or respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia Objective: To characterize complications among infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Study design Retrospective data from 684 infants with bronchiolitis or RSV pneumonia, 1 year old, admitted to 10 children's hospitals from April 1995 to September 1996. Outcomes included complication rates and effects on hospital and pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) length of stay (LOS) and hospital costs. Results: Most infants (79%) had one or more complication, with serious complications in 24%. Even minor complications were associated with significantly longer PICU and hospital LOS and higher costs (P < .001). Respiratory complications were most frequent (60%), but infectious (41%), cardiovascular (9%), electrolyte imbalance (19%), and other complications (9%) were common. Complication rates were higher in former premature infants (87%), infants with congenital heart disease (93%), and infants with other congenital abnormalities (90%) relative to infants without risk factors (76%). Infants 33 to 35 weeks gestational age (GA) had the highest complication rates (93%), longer hospital LOS, and higher costs (P < .004) than other former premature infants. Conclusions: Complications were common in infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis or RSV pneumonia and were associated with longer LOS and higher costs. Former premature infants and infants with congenital abnormalities are at significantly greater risk for complications. Broader use of RSV prevention should be considered for these higher-risk infants.

379,"Biomarkers of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection: Specific neutrophil and cytokine levels provide increased accuracy in predicting disease severity Despite fundamental advances in the research on respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) since its initial identification almost 60 years ago, recurring failures in developing vaccines and pharmacologic strategies effective in controlling the infection have allowed RSV to become a leading cause of global infant morbidity and mortality. Indeed, the burden of this infection on families and health care organizations worldwide continues to escalate and its financial costs are growing. Furthermore, strong epidemiologic evidence indicates that early-life lower respiratory tract infections caused by RSV lead to the development of recurrent wheezing and childhood asthma. While some progress has been made in the identification of reliable biomarkers for RSV bronchiolitis, a ""one size fits all"" biomarker capable of accurately and consistently predicting disease severity and post-acute outcomes has yet to be discovered. Therefore, it is of great importance on a global scale to identify useful biomarkers for this infection that will allow pediatricians to cost-effectively predict the clinical course of the disease, as well as monitor the efficacy of new therapeutic strategies.

754,"Revised Indications for the Use of Palivizumab and Respiratory Syncytial Virus Immune Globulin Intravenous for the Prevention of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections Palivizumab and Respiratory Syncytial Virus Immune Globulin Intravenous (RSV-IGIV) are licensed by the Food and Drug Administration for use in preventing severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections in high-risk infants, children younger than 24 months with chronic lung disease (formerly called bronchopulmonary dysplasia), and certain preterm infants. This report summarizes the clinical trial information on which the guidance in the accompanying policy statement for administering RSV prophylaxis to certain children with a history of preterm birth, chronic lung disease, or congenital heart disease is based. On the basis of results of a recently completed clinical trial, palivizumab is appropriate for infants and young children with hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease. RSV-IGIV should not be used in children with hemodynamically significant heart disease. Palivizumab is preferred for most high-risk infants and children because of ease of intramuscular administration. Monthly administration of palivizumab during the RSV season results in a 45% to 55% decrease in the rate of hospitalization attributable to RSV. Because of the large number of infants born after 32 to 35 weeks' gestation and because of the high cost, immunoprophylaxis should be considered for this category of preterm infants only if 2 or more risk factors are present.

641,"Human respiratory syncytial virus and influenza seasonality patternsEarly findings from the WHO global respiratory syncytial virus surveillance Background: Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes illnesses among all age groups and presents a burden to healthcare services. To better understand the epidemiology and seasonality of RSV in different geographical areas, the World Health Organization (WHO) coordinated a pilot initiative to access the feasibility of establishing RSV surveillance using the existing Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) platform. Objectives: To describe and compare RSV and influenza seasonality in countries in the northern andsouthern temperate, and tropics during the period January 2017 to April 2019. Methods: Fourteen countries in six WHO regions participating in the GISRS were invited for the pilot. Hospitalized patients presenting with severe acute respiratory illness (SARI), SARI without fever and outpatients presenting with acute respiratory illness (ARI) were enrolled from January 2017 to April 2019. The expected minimum sample size was 20 samples per week, year-round, per country. Real-time RT-PCR was used to detect RSV and influenza viruses. Results were uploaded to the WHO FluMart platform. Results: Annual seasonality of RSV was observed in all countries, which overlapped to a large extent with the influenza activity. In countries, in temperate regions RSV peaked in the autumn/winter months. In Egypt, a subtropical country, RSV activity peaked in the cooler season. In the tropical regions, RSV peaked during the rainy seasons. Conclusion: Early findings from the WHO RSV surveillance pilot based on the GISRS suggest annual seasonal patterns for of RSV circulation that overlap with influenza. RSV surveillance needs to be continued for several more seasons to establish seasonality patterns to inform prevention and control strategies. (Chadha M.)

22,"Morbidity and mortality after RSV-associated hospitalizations among premature canadian infants Objective: To evaluate the impact of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections on subsequent health care resource utilization in preterm infants. Study design: Analysis of data from 2415 preterm infants (32 to 35 weeks gestational age [GA]) hospitalized for proven or probable RSV and matched to 20,254 control infants. Results: Mean (SD) age at the index admission was 7.7 (5.5) months; 46% of the infants were male. Mean (SD) subsequent health services, excluding the index event, for the RSV cohort and control infants, respectively, were hospitalization, 2.96 (2.81) versus 1.28 (1.42); special care unit visits, 0.67 (1.70) versus 0.40 (0.33); respiratory therapy visits, 0:31 (0.70) versus 0.13 (0.37); physician consults, 3.61 (4.54) versus 0.89 (1.12); in-hospital procedures, 1.05 (4.02) versus 0.81 (1.51); outpatient visits, 18.4 (10.58) versus 7.54 (4.31); and mean (SD) inpatient days, 14.71 (18.69) versus 5.04 (7.09). All differences were statistically significant (P < .001). Diagnoses for the RSV and control cohorts were respiratory conditions (64% versus 13%), fever (2.7% versus 0.7%), anorexia (2.2% versus 0.6%), lack of normal physiological development (2.8% versus 1.1%; P < .05), overall deaths (8.1% versus 1.6%; P < .001), and sudden death (6.1% versus 0.3%; P < .001).

228,"Respiratory syncytial virus immune globulin: Decisions and costs A decision analysis was used to evaluate the economic effectiveness of respiratory syncytial virus immune globulin (RSVIG) prophylaxis on selected pediatric populations at risk for developing RSV bronchiolitis or all respiratory illness-related hospitalizations. We compared costs, outcomes, and cost-effectiveness of administering RSVIG to no treatment in different pediatric populations, including those at risk of developing RSV-bronchiolitis and those at risk of developing any respiratory illness-related hospitalization. We observed that if only infants at high risk of severe RSV infections received treatment with RSVIG, a calculated cost saving of about $27,000 per hospitalization prevented were realized. If the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved indications for RSVIG were followed, the cost to prevent one hospitalization due to RSV bronchiolitis would be over $53,000. If the aim, however, was to prevent all respiratory illness-related hospitalizations for this broader population, a much lower cost ($4,000) to prevent one hospitalization would result. In this situation, cost neutrality was possible, with a therapy cost of $2,843 compared to the actual average therapy cost of $4,444. Sensitivity analysis showed that the model was relatively insensitive to all variables, with the exceptions of costs related to RSVIG and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. We conclude that RSVIG resulted in cost savings if therapy were reserved for the infants who are at highest risk for developing severe RSV infections. RSVIG is not cost-effective for preventing RSV bronchiolitis when used according to the FDA-approved indications. Education that emphasizes frequent hand-washing, avoidance of passive smoking, and lessening exposure to sick children remains the least expensive prevention tool.  2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

879,"Respiratory Syncytial Virus in Older Adults: A Hidden Annual Epidemic Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common cause of medically significant respiratory tract illnesses in adults 65 years and older. The clinical presentation of RSV is largely indistinguishable from other respiratory infections including influenza, limiting awareness of its burden and impact among health care professionals and the public. Although no specific treatment in adults or licensed vaccine to prevent the disease is currently available, several promising candidate vaccines and treatments are on the horizon. Recognizing and defining the impact of RSV in older adults is important to evaluate the impact of these new prevention and treatment options. Public health and health care professionals need to be aware about RSV so they can advise the general public and older patients about the importance of prevention.

539,"Evaluation of the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of ALN-RSV01, a novel RNAi antiviral therapeutic directed against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) work through RNA interference (RNAi), the natural RNA inhibitory pathway, to down-regulate protein production by inhibiting targeted mRNA in a sequence-specific manner. ALN-RSV01 is an siRNA directed against the mRNA encoding the N-protein of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) that exhibits specific in vitro and in vivo anti-RSV activity. The results of two safety and tolerability studies with ALN-RSV01 involving 101 healthy adults (65 active, 36 placebo, single- and multiple dose, observer-blind, randomized dose-escalation) are described. Intranasal administration of ALN-RSV01 was well tolerated over a dose range up through 150 mg as a single dose and for five daily doses. Adverse events were similar in frequency and severity to placebo (normal saline) and were transient, mild to moderate, with no dose-dependent trend. The frequency or severity of adverse events did not increase with increasing ALN-RSV01 exposure. All subjects completed all treatments and assessments with no early withdrawals or serious adverse events. Physical examinations, vital signs, ECGs and laboratory tests were normal. Systemic bioavailability of ALN-RSV01 was minimal. ALN-RSV01 appears safe and well tolerated when delivered intranasally and is a promising therapeutic candidate for further clinical development.  2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

107,"Modelling estimates of age-specific influenza-related hospitalisation and mortality in the United Kingdom BACKGROUND: Influenza is rarely confirmed with laboratory testing and accurate assessment of the overall burden of influenza is difficult. We used statistical modelling methods to generate updated, granular estimates of the number/rate of influenza-attributable hospitalisations and deaths in the United Kingdom. Such data are needed on a continuing basis to inform on cost-benefit analyses of treatment interventions, including vaccination.METHODS: Weekly age specific data on hospital admissions (1997-2009) and on deaths (1997-2009) were obtained from national databases. Virology reports (1996-2009) of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus detections were provided by Public Health England. We used an expanded set of ICD-codes to estimate the burden of illness attributable to influenza which we refer to as 'respiratory disease broadly defined'. These codes were chosen to optimise the balance between sensitivity and specificity. A multiple linear regression model controlled for respiratory syncytial virus circulation, with stratification by age and the presence of comorbid risk status (conditions associated with severe influenza outcomes).RESULTS: In the United Kingdom there were 28,516 hospitalisations and 7163 deaths estimated to be attributable to influenza respiratory disease in a mean season, with marked variability between seasons. The highest incidence rates of influenza-attributable hospitalisations and deaths were observed in adults aged 75+ years (252/100,000 and 131/100,000 population, respectively). Influenza B hospitalisations were highest among 5-17 year olds (12/100,000 population). Of all estimated influenza respiratory deaths in 75+ year olds, 50 % occurred out of hospital, and 25 % in 50-64 year olds. Rates of hospitalisations and death due to influenza-attributable respiratory disease were increased in adults identified as at-risk.CONCLUSIONS: Our study points to a substantial but highly variable seasonal influenza burden in all age groups, particularly affecting 75+ year olds. Effective influenza prevention or early intervention with anti-viral treatment in this age group may substantially impact the disease burden and associated healthcare costs. The high burden of influenza B hospitalisation among 5-17 year olds supports current United Kingdom vaccine policy to extend quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccination to this age group.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrial.gov, NCT01520935.

50,"Human metapneumovirus infection is associated with severe respiratory disease in preschool children with history of prematurity Background Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a recently discovered respiratory pathogen of the family Paramyxoviridae, the same family as that of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Premature children are at high risk of severe RSV infections, however, it is unclear whether HMPV infection is more severe in hospitalized children with a history of severe prematurity. Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of the clinical respiratory presentation of all polymerase chain reaction-confirmed HMPV infections in preschool-age children (5 years) with and without history of severe prematurity (<32 weeks gestation). Respiratory distress scores were developed to examine the clinical severity of HMPV infections. Demographic and clinical variables were obtained from reviewing electronic medical records. Results A total of 571 preschool children were identified using polymerase chain reaction-confirmed viral respiratory tract infection during the study period. HMPV was identified as a causative organism in 63 cases (11%). Fifty-eight (n = 58) preschool-age children with HMPV infection were included in this study after excluding those with significant comorbidities. Our data demonstrated that 32.7% of children admitted with HMPV had a history of severe prematurity. Preschool children with a history of prematurity had more severe HMPV disease as illustrated by longer hospitalizations, new or increased need for supplemental O(2), and higher severity scores independently of age, ethnicity, and history of asthma. Conclusion Our study suggests that HMPV infection causes significant disease burden among preschool children with a history of prematurity leading to severe respiratory infections and increasing health care resource utilization due to prolonged hospitalizations.

27,"Economic and Clinical Outcomes of Pediatric Patients Under Two With Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection in Thailand: A Real-world Retrospective Cohort Study Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common cause of acute respiratory tract infection in children, including in Thailand. We conducted this study to evaluate the economic and clinical outcomes of patients <2 years old with RSV infection at a tertiary teaching hospital in Thailand. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study during 2014-2021. To be eligible, patients had to report at least 1 positive RSV test and were <2 years old. Descriptive statistics were used to describe baseline characteristics, healthcare resource utilization, direct medical costs (1 US dollars [USD] = 31.98 Thai Baht) and clinical outcomes. Results: Among 1370 RSV-positive patients, 49.9% of the patients (n = 683) were hospitalized at or within 3 days of RSV diagnosis with a median length of stay of 6 days (interquartile range [IQR]: 4-9 days), 38.8% were diagnosed with RSV-related respiratory complications (n = 532) and 1.5% died during the hospitalization episode (n = 20). A total of 22.5% of hospitalized patients (n = 154) received critical care during the hospitalization episode. The median cost of each RSV episode was USD539 (IQR: USD167-USD2106) and was higher among hospitalized patients (median: USD2112; IQR: USD1379-USD3182) compared with nonhospitalized patients (median: USD167; IQR: USD112-USD276). Conclusions: RSV infection represents a potentially important contributor to healthcare resource use and medical costs among children <2 years old in Thailand. Coupled with epidemiologic data, findings from our study will be useful to illustrate the overall economic burden associated with RSV infection among children in Thailand.

576,"Respiratory Syncytial Virus-Associated Mortality among Young Infants in Karachi, Pakistan: A Prospective Postmortem Surveillance Study Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an important cause of infant morbidity and mortality and a potential target for maternal immunization strategies. However, data on the role of RSV in young infant deaths in developing countries are limited. Methods: We conducted a community-based mortality surveillance from August 2018-March 2020 for infants 6 months in Karachi, Pakistan. We tested (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) nasopharyngeal swabs from deceased infants for presence of RSV. We performed verbal autopsies and calculated odds of RSV-associated mortality with 95% CIs and used multivariable logistic regression to evaluate associations. Results: We collected 490 nasopharyngeal specimens from 1280 eligible infant deaths. There were 377/490 (76.9%) live births and 14/377 (3.7%; 95% CI: 1.8-5.6) were RSV positive. Most deaths occurred in neonates (254/377; 67.4%), males (226/377; 59.9%), and respiratory illnesses (206/377; 54.6%). Postneonatal age (10/14, 71.4%; OR: 5.5; 95% CI: 1.7-18.0), respiratory symptoms (12/14, 85.7%; OR: 5.2; 1.2-23.7), and high RSV season (9/14, 64.3%; OR: 4.4; 1.4-13.3) were associated with RSV mortality. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, respiratory symptoms (OR: 6.6; 95% CI: 1.3-32.5), RSV seasonality (6.1; 1.8-20.4), and age (9.2; 2.6-33.1) were significant predictors of RSV-associated mortality. Conclusions: RSV has a significant mortality burden in early infancy in Karachi, Pakistan. Age, RSV seasonality, and respiratory symptoms were significant predictors of RSV-associated mortality.

326,"Epidemiological aspects of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections in Italy: A national survey Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of respiratory infections such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia in babies and children, producing serious infections and short- to medium-term complications. We conducted a survey, using a questionnaire, to determine the opinions of paediatricians on the geographical and seasonal distribution, and the clinical impact of RSV in Italy. Of the 344 paediatricians who responded, 66% had admitted children affected by RSV into their department, and 38% of these had admitted more than 10 cases during the preceding year. According to those interviewed, newborn babies of lowest gestational age were most often affected. The children considered to be at highest risk of severe infection were those with bronchodysplasia, immunodeficiencies or congenital heart disease; most admissions (87%) were attributed to bronchiolitis. In southern Italy and the islands RSV appeared later and persisted later into the year than in central and northern Italy. Most paediatricians (79%) considered the available treatments for serious RSV ineffective but only half were aware of the possibility of immunoprophylaxis against RSV. (Alvaro G.)

963,"Unexpected infection spikes in a model of respiratory syncytial virus vaccination Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is an acute respiratory infection that infects millions of children and infants worldwide. Recent research has shown promise for the development of a vaccine, with a range of vaccine types now in clinical trials or preclinical development. We extend an existing mathematical model with seasonal transmission to include vaccination. We model vaccination both as a continuous process, applying the vaccine during pregnancy, and as a discrete one, using impulsive differential equations, applying pulse vaccination. We develop conditions for the stability of the disease-free equilibrium and show that this equilibrium can be destabilised under certain extreme conditions, even with 100% coverage using an (unrealistic) vaccine. Using impulsive differential equations and introducing a new quantity, the impulsive reproduction number, we showed that eradication could be acheived with 75% coverage, while 50% coverage resulted in low-level oscillations. A vaccine that targets RSV infection has the potential to significantly reduce the overall prevalence of the disease, but appropriate coverage is critical.

144,"Over-The-Counter Hearing Aids: Trends in Information-Seeking Behavior Recent Food and Drug Administration approval of over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aids has changed the policy landscape surrounding hearing-assistive technology. Our objective was to characterize trends in information-seeking behavior in the era of OTC hearing aids. Using Google Trends, we extracted the relative search volume (RSV) for hearing health-related topics. The mean RSV in the 2 weeks preceding and following enactment of the FDA's OTC hearing aid ruling were compared using a paired samples t-test. RSV for hearing-related queries increased by 212.5% on the date of FDA approval. There was a 25.6% (p =.02) increase in mean RSV for hearing aids before and after the FDA ruling. The most popular searches focused on specific device brands and cost. States with more rural residents represented the highest proportion of queries. Understanding these trends is critical to ensure appropriate patient counseling and improve access to hearing assistive technology.

377,"Novel respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) genotype ON1 predominates in germany during winter season 2012-13 Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of hospitalization especially in young children with respiratory tract infections (RTI). Patterns of circulating RSV genotypes can provide a better understanding of the molecular epidemiology of RSV infection. We retrospectively analyzed the genetic diversity of RSV infection in hospitalized children with acute RTI admitted to University Hospital Heidelberg/Germany between October 2012 and April 2013. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) were routinely obtained in 240 children younger than 2 years of age who presented with clinical symptoms of upper or lower RTI. We analyzed NPAs via PCR and sequence analysis of the second variable region of the RSV G gene coding for the attachment glycoprotein. We obtained medical records reviewing routine clinical data. RSV was detected in 134/240 children. In RSV-positive patients the most common diagnosis was bronchitis/bronchiolitis (75.4%). The mean duration of hospitalization was longer in RSV-positive compared to RSV-negative patients (3.5 vs. 5.1 days; p<0.01). RSV-A was detected in 82.1%, RSV-B in 17.9% of all samples. Phylogenetic analysis of 112 isolates revealed that the majority of RSV-A strains (65%) belonged to the novel ON1 genotype containing a 72-nucleotide duplication. However, genotype ON1 was not associated with a more severe course of illness when taking basic clinical/laboratory parameters into account. Molecular characterization of RSV confirms the co-circulation of multiple genotypes of subtype RSV-A and RSV-B. The duplication in the G gene of genotype ON1 might have an effect on the rapid spread of this emerging RSV strain.

427,"Burden of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Hospitalizations in Canada Objective. To examine the socioeconomic burden of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease for Canadian infants hospitalized for the condition. Data and Methods. The descriptive study used data collected in Alberta, Canada, during 2 consecutive RSV seasons. Infants (<1 year of age) were included if they had not received palivizumab and were hospitalized with a confirmed diagnosis of RSV. Hospitalization resource use and parental time burden, out-of-pocket costs, lost work productivity, and stress and anxiety were assessed. Results. 13.4% of all infants (n = 67) had intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and average ICU stay for these infants was 6.5 days. Families had average out-of-pocket expenses of 736.69 Canadian dollars (CAD $), and the average time both parents spent in hospital was nearly 7 days (164.0 hours). For working parents (n = 43), average absenteeism was 49% and overall work impairment was 77.8%. Parents also exhibited significant parental stress (3.6 on the Parental Stressor Scale: 43.9 state anxiety and 36.9 trait anxiety scores). Conclusions. Results indicate a high burden associated with the hospitalization of an infant due to RSV disease in terms of resource use, time, productivity, costs, and stress, even among a population of infants not considered to be at risk for the condition.

51,"A population study of respiratory rehospitalisation in very preterm infants in the first 3 years of life Aim: Very premature infants consume healthcare resources following discharge from neonatal intensive care units (NICU). This study aimed to evaluate the burden of respiratory related rehospitalisation within the first 3 years post discharge in very premature infants in an Australian population. Methods: Rehospitalisation of a 4-year cohort of NICU survivors, born less than 32 weeks gestation, was derived from data linkage of three state-wide databases including NSW Neonatal Intensive Care Units' Data Collection, Admitted Patient Data Collection and the Death Registry. Rehospitalisation diagnoses were determined by ICD-10 AM codes. Results: Of the 2939 survivors, 525 (18%) had bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and 261 BPD infants (50%) were discharged on home oxygen. Almost two-third (1860, 63%) of the survivors are required rehospitalisation, respiratory causes, including 394 respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-related, accounted for 2668 (48%) of the 5599 rehospitalisations. Significantly more home oxygen BPD survivors had respiratory (70%) and RSV-related (22%) rehospitalisations than the BPD infants not needing home oxygen (58% and 18%, respectively), and the survivors without BPD had the lowest rates (32% and 10%, P < 0.001). Most respiratory (61%) and RSV-related (74%) rehospitalisations occurred during the first 12 months post discharge. No RSV-related fatality occurred. Amongst the total 17 562 hospital days, respiratory and RSV-related admissions accounted for 10 905 (62%) and 3031 (17.2%) days. In multivariable logistic analyses, home oxygen and maternal indigenous status were independently associated with high (3 or more) respiratory and RSV rehospitalisation rates. Conclusions: Respiratory rehospitalisations are common in very premature survivors. Home oxygen and indigenous status are significant risk factors for respiratory and RSV-related rehospitalisations.

840,"Hospitalizations due to respiratory syncytial virus outside of the typical season Objective: Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is the most common cause of bronchiolitis and viral lower respiratory tract infections in children. It is associated with annual winter epidemics across the United States, typically October through April. Our objective is to describe the clinical characteristics of children hospitalized outside the typical RSV season and to compare them with those admitted during the season. Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted of all patients who were hospitalized at Children's Hospital of Austin from May 2000 to September 2006 and had a positive RSV antigen test. Descriptive statistics, tests of differences, and associations between patients diagnosed in the off-season versus typical season were conducted. Results: A total of 850 charts of RSV-positive cases were reviewed. Of these, 45 patients (5.3%) were admitted during the off-season. The following variables were statistically significantly associated with diagnosis in the off-season versus typical season: mean birth weight (2704 g vs. 3204 g respectively, p=0.0001); gestational age at birth less than 36 weeks (OR=4.35; 95% CI: 2.2, 8.6); history of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission at birth (OR=6.04; 95% CI: 2.9, 12.5); and multiple birth (OR=3.38; 95% CI: 1.2, 9.2). Conclusions: Infants with RSV infection outside of the typical season were more likely to have been premature, of lower birth weight, the products of multiple births, and admitted to the NICU at birth.  2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

During high-flow nasal cannula ventilation, the blood's high levels of hypercapnia had taken them to plan the sedation and the orotracheal intubation. However, before attempting intubation, a nasal high frequency oscillatory ventilation cycle was performed and it led to a marked improvement in the blood gas, avoiding in this way the invasive ventilation.

989,"Risk factors for respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis hospitalizations in children with chronic diseases Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis is the most common lower respiratory tract disorder causing hospitalization in infants. Due to decreased hospitalization rates of premature infants following Palivizumab immune prophylaxis, the proportion of infants with chronic diseases not eligible for Palivizumab has increased. Aim: To characterize infants hospitalized during 20142018 with RSV bronchiolitis, to compare between those with and without chronic conditions, and to identify risk factors for severe disease. Methods: This retrospective study analyzed demographic and clinical data of patients younger than 2 years admitted with bronchiolitis during four consecutive RSV seasons. Results: Of 1124 hospitalizations due to RSV bronchiolitis, 244 (22%) were in infants with chronic diseases. Although 20/1124 qualified for RSV prophylaxis, only eight received immune prophylaxis. Compared to otherwise healthy infants, children with chronic diseases had longer hospitalizations, median 4.8 days (interquartile range [IQR]: 3.48.3) versus 3.7 days (IQR: 2.75.1), p <.001; and higher pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and readmission rates (9% vs. 4.5%, p =.007% and 3% vs. 1%, p =.055, respectively). Children with Down's syndrome comprised 2% of all hospitalizations, but 8% of PICU admissions; their median length of hospitalization was 10.7 days (IQR: 6.617.6). Respiratory tract malformations were present in 2% of hospitalizations, and comprised 4% of PICU admissions. Conclusion: Among infants admitted with RSV bronchiolitis, those with chronic diseases had longer hospitalizations and higher rates of transfer to the PICU. Children with multiple comorbidities, and especially those with Down's syndrome, are at particularly high risk for severe hospitalization and may benefit from RSV immune prophylaxis.

Design: Retrospective descriptive study. Setting: Australian ICUs contributing data to the Australian and New Zealand Paediatric Intensive Care (ANZPIC) Registry. The number of contributing ICUs increased over the study period, from 8 specialist paediatric ICUs in 1997 to 8 specialist paediatric and 13 general ICUs in 2013. Participants: All paediatric (<16 years) ICU admissions, coded as pertussis-related, between 1 January 1997 and 31 December 2013. Results: A total of 373 pertussis-coded ICU admissions were identified in the ANZPIC Registry over the study period. Of these cases, 52.8% occurred during the 4 years of the recent Australian epidemic (2009-2012). ICU admissions were most likely to occur in infants aged younger than 6 weeks (41.8%, n=156) and aged 6 weeks to 4 months (42.9%, n=160). The median length of stay for pertussis related ICU admissions was 3.6 days, with 77.5% of cases staying in ICU for <7 days. Approximately half of all admissions (54.8%) required some form of respiratory support, with 32.7% requiring invasive respiratory support. Over the study period, 23 deaths were recorded (6.2% of pertussis-related ICU admissions), of which 20 (87.0%) were infants <4 months old. Conclusions: Pertussis-related ICU admissions occur primarily in infants too young to be fully protected from active immunisation. More needs to be done to protect these high-risk infants, such as maternal immunisation. (Kaczmarek M.C., m.kaczmarek@uq.edu.au; Ware R.S.; Lambert S.B.)

Palivizumab guidelines should reflect the latest evidence, in addition to cost-effectiveness and healthcare budgetary considerations. RSV experts from Europe, Canada and Israel undertook a systematic review of the evidence over the last 5 years and developed recommendations regarding prophylaxis in industrialised countries. Almost 400 publications were reviewed. This group recommended palivizumab for: preterm infants (<29 and 31 weeks gestational age [wGA] and 9 and 6 months of age, respectively; high-risk 3235 wGA), former preterm children 24 months with chronic lung disease/bronchopulmonary dysplasia, children 24 months with significant congenital heart disease; and other high-risk populations, such as children 24 months with Down syndrome, pulmonary/neuromuscular disorders, immunocompromised, and cystic fibrosis. Up to 5 monthly doses should be administered over the RSV season. It is our impression that the adoption of these guidelines would help reduce the burden of RSV. (Luna M.S.)

223,"Early-life respiratory syncytial virus lower respiratory tract infection in a South African birth cohort: epidemiology and effect on lung health Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in children. Early-life RSV LRTI might affect long-term health but there are few data from low-income and middle-income countries. We investigated the epidemiology and effect of early-life RSV LRTI on lung health in a South African birth cohort. Methods: We conducted the Drakenstein Child Health Study (DCHS), an ongoing birth cohort longitudinal study in the Western Cape province, South Africa. We enrolled pregnant women aged 18 years or older during their second trimester of pregnancy at two public health clinics. We followed up study children from birth to 2 years. The primary outcome of the study was LRTI and RSV LRTI. LRTI and wheezing episodes were identified through active surveillance; respiratory samples were tested for RSV and other pathogens. Wheezing was longitudinally identified by caregiver report and ascertainment at health facilities. Lung function was measured from 6 weeks to 2 years. We analysed the associations between RSV LRTI and subsequent LRTI, wheezing, and lung function using generalised estimating equations and mixed-effects linear regression. Findings: We enrolled 1137 mothers between March 5, 2012, and March 31, 2015. Among their 1143 infants, accruing 2093 child-years of follow-up, there were 851 cases of LRTI (incidence 041 episodes per child-year, 95% CI 038043). Admission to hospital owing to LRTI occurred in 169 (20%) cases (incidence 008 episodes per child-year, 007009), with a case-fatality ratio of 05%. RSV was detected in 164 (21%) of 785 LRTI events with a specimen available for qPCR, an incidence of 008 episodes per child-year (007009); highest at age 06 months (015 episodes per child-year, 012019). Children with a first RSV LRTI were three times as likely to develop recurrent LRTI compared with those with non-RSV LRTI (032 [022048] vs 010 [007 016] episodes per child-year; p<00001), particularly following hospitalised RSV LRTI. RSV LRTI and hospitalisation for all-cause LRTI were independently associated with recurrent wheezing (adjusted incident rate ratio 141, 95% CI 125159, for RSV LRTI and 148, 130168, for hospitalisation). LRTI or recurrent LRTI was associated with impaired lung function, but a similar outcome was observed following RSV LRTI or non-RSV LRTI. All-cause LRTI was associated with an average 3% higher respiratory rate (95% CI 001006; p=0013) and lower compliance (01, 018 to 002) at 2 years compared with no LRTI. Recurrent LRTI was associated with further increased respiratory rate (001, 0001002), resistance (077 hPa s L(1), 007147), and lower compliance (06 mL hPa(1), 009 to 002) with each additional event. Interpretation: RSV LRTI was common in young infants and associated with recurrent LRTI, particularly after hospitalised RSV. Hospitalisation for all-cause LRTI, especially for RSV-LRTI, was associated with recurrent wheezing. Impairments in lung function followed LRTI or recurrent episodes, but were not specific to RSV. New preventive strategies for RSV might have an effect on long-term lung health.

To collect data on hospitalization rates for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) illness during the season of 1999 to 2000 in nonprophylaxed premature infants 32 weeks gestational age (GA) in Spain and compare this with previously published data collected in the season of 1998 to 1999. Methods. Children born at 32 weeks GA between April 1, 1999, and April 31, 2000, and discharged from the hospital before April 31, 2000, were included. Neonatal and demographic data were obtained at the initial visit. Study subjects were followed at monthly intervals throughout the respiratory season. RSV status and morbidity data were collected on patients rehospitalized for respiratory illness. Results. The 999 evaluable patients in the 2000 season were comparable to the 1999 sample, except for higher rates of family allergy history and number of multiple deliveries and a lower rate of neonatal morbidity. The hospitalization rate for RSV illness was 13.4% in the 1999 season and 13.1% in the 2000 season; 10 (8%) were RSV reinfections in the 2000 season. Significant independent prognostic variables for high risk of RSV hospital admission included: lower gestational age; chronologic age <3 months at onset of the RSV season; living with school age siblings; and exposure to tobacco smoke. Conclusions. Hospitalization rates for RSV disease in nonprophylaxed preterm infants 32 weeks GA were high in Spain and comparable during two consecutive RSV seasons (13%).

417,"Latitudinal Variations in Seasonal Activity of Influenza and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV): A Global Comparative Review Background: There is limited information on influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) seasonal patterns in tropical areas, although there is renewed interest in understanding the seasonal drivers of respiratory viruses. Methods: We review geographic variations in seasonality of laboratory-confirmed influenza and RSV epidemics in 137 global locations based on literature review and electronic sources. We assessed peak timing and epidemic duration and explored their association with geography and study settings. We fitted time series model to weekly national data available from the WHO influenza surveillance system (FluNet) to further characterize seasonal parameters. Results: Influenza and RSV activity consistently peaked during winter months in temperate locales, while there was greater diversity in the tropics. Several temperate locations experienced semi-annual influenza activity with peaks occurring in winter and summer. Semi-annual activity was relatively common in tropical areas of Southeast Asia for both viruses. Biennial cycles of RSV activity were identified in Northern Europe. Both viruses exhibited weak latitudinal gradients in the timing of epidemics by hemisphere, with peak timing occurring later in the calendar year with increasing latitude (P<0.03). Time series model applied to influenza data from 85 countries confirmed the presence of latitudinal gradients in timing, duration, seasonal amplitude, and between-year variability of epidemics. Overall, 80% of tropical locations experienced distinct RSV seasons lasting 6 months or less, while the percentage was 50% for influenza. Conclusion: Our review combining literature and electronic data sources suggests that a large fraction of tropical locations experience focused seasons of respiratory virus activity in individual years. Information on seasonal patterns remains limited in large undersampled regions, included Africa and Central America. Future studies should attempt to link the observed latitudinal gradients in seasonality of viral epidemics with climatic and population factors, and explore regional differences in disease transmission dynamics and attack rates.

984,"Adolescent asthma after rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis Background and Aims Asthma risk is increased after bronchiolitis in infancy. Recent studies have suggested that the risk may be dependent on the causative virus. The aim of the study was to evaluate the asthma risk in adolescence in subjects hospitalized for rhinovirus or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis in infancy. Subjects and Methods At the median age of 16.5 years, a questionnaire was sent to 96 study subjects hospitalized for bronchiolitis at <24 months of age and since then prospectively followed-up. Sixty-seven (70%) returned the fulfilled questionnaire. RSV and rhinovirus etiology of bronchiolitis had been studied in serum and respiratory samples obtained on admission in infancy. The occurrence of asthma was compared between former bronchiolitis patients and population controls recruited for this study in adolescence. Results Doctor-diagnosed asthma was present in 30% of former bronchiolitis patients and in 5% of controls (OR 7.9, 95% CI 3.3-19.3). The respective figures for self-reported asthma were 64% and 11% (OR 14.7, 95% CI 7.2-30.0). Self-reported asthma was more common in the former rhinovirus than RSV patients (83.3% vs. 47.6%, P = 0.023, mixed infections included; 81.3% vs. 50%, P = 0.067, mixed infections excluded). Conclusions Patients hospitalized for RSV and rhinovirus bronchiolitis at <24 months of age had an increased asthma risk at 15-18 years of age compared with population controls. Within the former bronchiolitis group, the risk of self-reported asthma was higher after non-RSV versus RSV and after rhinovirus versus non-rhinovirus bronchiolitis.

692,"Hospital admissions and need for mechanical ventilation in children with respiratory syncytial virus before and during the COVID-19 pandemic: a Danish nationwide cohort study Background: The incidence of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) increased in several countries after the relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions. We aimed to investigate the age-related risk of RSV-associated hospital admissions and need for mechanical ventilation during the RSV resurgence in summer and autumn 2021 compared with the four RSV seasons preceding the COVID-19 pandemic. We also aimed to describe the clinical complications necessitating mechanical ventilation. Methods: This population-based cohort study included patients aged 017 years admitted to hospital with RSV in Denmark during the RSV resurgence in summer and autumn 2021, and the four pre-COVID-19 RSV seasons (201617, 201718, 201819, and 201920). We retrieved data on RSV-associated hospital admissions from the Danish National Patient Registry and demographic and clinical details of children who received mechanical ventilation through prospective real-time data collection in 202122 and retrospective data collection for the 201617 to 201920 RSV seasons from all eight paediatric and neonatal intensive care units in Denmark. Risk factors for severe RSV disease were as defined as age younger than 3 months or severe comorbidities. We calculated the risk of RSV-associated hospital admissions per 100 000 population in each RSV season from week 21 to week 20 of the following year. We also calculated the risk rate of receiving mechanical ventilation per 100 000 population and 1000 RSV-associated hospital admissions during each RSV season from week 21 to week 20 of the following year. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) for hospital admission and mechanical ventilation by dividing the risk rate of hospital admission and mechanical ventilation in 202122 by annual mean risk rates in the four pre-COVID-19 RSV epidemics (201617 to 201920). We compared RRs using Fisher's exact test. We compared complications leading to intubation between children with and without risk factors for severe RSV disease. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05186597. Findings: Among 310 423 Danish children aged younger than 5 years, the mean number of RSV-associated hospital admissions increased from 1477 (SD 226) in the 201617 to 201920 RSV seasons to 3000 in the 202122 RSV season (RR 20 [95% CI 1921]). 54 children with RSV received mechanical ventilation in 202122 compared with 1528 annually in the 201617 to 201920 RSV seasons (23 [1633]). The highest increase in hospital admissions and need for mechanical ventilation occurred among children aged 2459 months (41 [3647] for hospital admission; 46 [17126] for mechanical ventilation). Among children admitted to hospital, the risk of mechanical ventilation was similar in 202122 and the four pre-COVID-19 seasons (risk rate 143 per 1000 RSV-associated hospital admissions [95% CI 104193] vs 129 [101161]; RR 11 [95% CI 0816]). Across all RSV seasons studied, among children younger than 3 months or those with severe comorbidities, respiratory failure due to bronchiolitis led to mechanical ventilation in 69 (79%) of 87 children. Of 46 children with no risk factors for severe RSV, 40 (87%) received mechanical ventilation due to additional complications, including neurological (n=16; 35%), cardiac (n=1; 2%), and pulmonary complications (n=23; 50%; eg, wheeze responsive to bronchodilator therapy, severe bacterial co-infections, and pneumothorax). Interpretation: In Denmark, RSV disease did not seem to be more severe for the individual child during the RSV resurgence in 2021 following relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions. However, hospital admissions were higher among older children, possibly due to a postponed first RSV infection or no recent reinfection. Older children without risk factors for severe RSV disease had atypical complications that led to intubation. If new RSV-preventive interventions for healthy infants delay first RSV infection, a higher number of older children might be admitted to hospital due to atypical clinical phenotypes, rather than classical bronchiolitis.

327,"Prevalence and genetic characterization of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in hospitalized children in Korea Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is the most common respiratory pathogen among infants and young children. To investigate the prevalence and genetic characteristics of HRSVs circulating in South Korea, we analyzed medical records of patients and performed molecular analysis of the G-protein gene of viruses detected from nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) of admitted patients at the Pediatrics Department of Chungbuk National University Hospital from April 2008 to April 2010. Epidemiological data revealed that the prevalence of HRSV infection was high during both winter seasons (October 2008 to February 2009 and November 2009 to February 2010). Of the 297 positive NPA specimens from infants or children tested, 67% were identified as HRSV-A while 33% were HRSV-B. The HRSV subgroup B was the most dominant in December 2008, but its dominance was dramatically replaced by HRSV subgroup A strains by February 2009. Phylogenetic analysis of the G protein sequences of HRSVs revealed novel genotypes within the HRSV-A (genotype CB-A) and B (genotypes BA11 and CB-B) subgroups in South Korea in addition to other strains identified in other countries. Molecular analysis also revealed genetic variability at the C-terminal end of the G proteins of the two HRSV subgroups, suggesting selection pressure in this region, which may potentially impact immune recognition. This is the first report of these HRSV variants in South Korea, indicating active genetic evolution of HRSV strains. Therefore, this study provides information on the molecular epidemiology of current HRSVs in the country and presents data for comparative analysis with other HRSV strains circulating worldwide.  2012 Springer-Verlag.

231,"Importance of respiratory syncytial virus as a predictor of hospital length of stay in bronchiolitis Introduction: Bronchiolitis is the leading cause of hospitalization in children. Estimate potentially preventable variables that impact the length of hospital stay are a priority to reduce the costs associated with this disease. This study aims to identify clinical variables associated with length of hospital stay of bronchiolitis in children in a tropical middle-income country Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study in 417 infants with bronchiolitis in tertiary centers in Colombia. All medical records of all patients admitted to the emergency department were reviewed. To identify factors independently associated we use negative binomial regression model, to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRR) and adjust for potential confounding variables Results: The median of the length of hospital stay was 3.68 days, with a range of 0.74 days to 29 days, 138 (33.17%) of patients have a hospital stay of 5 or more days. After modeling and controlling for potential confounders age <6 months, comorbidities (CHD or neurological), BPD, chest indrawing, RSV isolation, and C-reactive protein were independent predictors of LOS Conclusions: Our results show that in infants with bronchiolitis, RSV isolation, age <6 months, comorbidities (CHD or neurological), BPD, chest indrawing, and C-reactive protein were independent predictors of LOS. As a potentially modifiable risk factor, efforts to reduce the probability of RSV infection can reduce the high medical cost associates with prolonged LOS in bronchiolitis. (Buendia J.A.)

68,"Economic Burden and Health-Related Quality of Life of Respiratory Syncytial Virus and Influenza Infection in European Community-Dwelling Older Adults Background. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus infections result in a considerable mortality and morbidity among the aging population globally. Influenza vaccination for older adults before the seasonal influenza epidemic has been evaluated to be cost-effective in many countries. Interventions against RSV in older adults are in the pipeline, and evaluating their cost-effectiveness is crucial for decision making. To inform such evaluations, our aim was to estimate average costs and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in older adults with RSV and influenza infection. Methods. The European RESCEU observational cohort study followed 1040 relatively healthy community-dwelling older adults aged 60 years and older during 2 consecutive winter seasons. Health care resource use and HRQoL were collected and analyzed during RSV episodes, and also during influenza episodes. Country-specific unit cost data were mainly obtained from national databases. Direct costs were estimated from a patient, health care provider, and health care payers perspective, whereas indirect costs were estimated from a societal perspective. Due to small sample size, no formal statistical comparisons were made. Results. Thirty-six RSV and 60 influenza episodes were reported, including 1 hospitalization. Means (median; first-third quartile) of 26.4 (5.5; 047.3) direct and 4.4 (0; 00) indirect costs were reported per nonhospitalized RSV episode, and 42.5 (36; 3.366.7) direct and 32.1 (0; 00) indirect costs per nonhospitalized influenza episode. For RSV episodes, the utility value decreased from 0.896 (0.928; 0.8540.953) to 0.801 (0.854; 0.7120.937) from preseason to 1 week after symptom onset; for influenza, the change was from 0.872 (0.895; 0.8280.953) to 0.664 (0.686; 0.5740.797). Conclusions. The average costs and HRQoL estimates of older adults treated outside the hospital can be used to inform the design of future studies and the decision making regarding interventions to prevent RSV infection in older adults. Larger studies are needed to provide better country-specific and complementary cost estimates and to allow for formal statistical comparison of costs between RSV and influenza.

991,"Effect of palivizumab prophylaxis in decreasing respiratory syncytial virus hospitalizations in premature infants Background. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of hospitalization in preterm infants and infants with chronic lung disease (CLD). Palivizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, was approved in Europe in 1999 as prophylaxis against severe RSV-related respiratory illness. No multiple season data have been published on palivizumab effectiveness in European populations. Data collected during 4 years in Spain compared RSV hospitalization rates and risk factors in a cohort of palivizumab-prophylaxed and nonprophylaxed preterm infants. Methods. The first cohort was derived from 2 previous studies and included 1583 infants followed during 2 RSV seasons (1998 to 1999, 1999 to 2000) before palivizumab initiation in Spain. The second cohort included 1919 infants who received palivizumab prophylaxis for 2 subsequent respiratory seasons (2000 to 2001, 2001 to 2002). Both cohorts were preterm (32 weeks gestational age) and 6 months old at onset of RSV season. Results. The RSV hospitalization rate in the palivizumab-prophylaxed cohort was 3.95, and it was 13.25% in nonprophylaxed infants This 70% overall difference in RSV hospitalization was observed despite the palivizumab-prophylaxed group's lower gestational ages, more severe neonatal intensive care unit respiratory courses and higher incidence of CLD. Significant risk factors for RSV hospitalization in both cohorts included: lower gestational age; chronologic age <3 months at RSV season onset; school age siblings; and lower parental education. Nonprophylaxed children had a higher risk for RSV-related hospitalization than did prophylaxed patients (odds ratio, 3.86; 95% confidence interval, 2.83 to 5.25). Conclusion. Data from this study support the effectiveness of palivizumab in significantly modifying RSV-related hospitalizations in high risk preterm infants, with and without CLD, during two respiratory seasons.

270,"Pediatric intensive care unit admission due to respiratory syncytial virus: Retrospective multicenter study Background: We investigated the characteristics and clinical outcomes of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-related pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) hospitalization and assessed the palivizumab (PZ) prophylaxis eligibility according to different guidelines from Korea, EU, and USA. Methods: In this multicenter study, children <18 years of age hospitalized in six PICU from different hospitals due to severe RSV infection between September 2008 and March 2013 were included. A retrospective chart review was performed. Results: A total of 92 patients were identified. The median length of PICU stay was 6 days (range, 1154 days) and median PICU care cost was USD2,741 (range, USD55698 243). Of 62 patients who were <2 years old at the beginning of the RSV season, 33 (53.2%) were high-risk patients for severe RSV infection. Hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease (22.6%) was the most common risk factor, followed by chronic lung disease (11.3%), neuromuscular disease or congenital abnormality of the airway (NMD/CAA) (11.3%), and prematurity (8.1%). The percentage of patients eligible for PZ prophylaxis ranged from 38.7% to 48.4% based on the guidelines, but only two (2.2%) received PZ 30 days prior to PICU admission. The median duration of mechanical ventilation was longer in children with NDM/CAA than in those without risk factors (26 days; range, 24139 days vs 6 days, range, 268 days, P = 0.033). RSV-attributable mortality was 5.4%. Conclusions: Children <2 years old with already well-known high risks represent a significant proportion of RSV-related PICU admissions. Increasing of the compliance for PZ prophylaxis practice among physicians is needed. Further studies are needed to investigate the burden of RSV infection in patients hospitalized in PICU, including children with NMD/CAA.

513,"Cardiac Troponin I as a Predictor of Respiratory Failure in Children Hospitalized with Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Infections: A Pilot Study This pilot study was performed to assess the use of cardiac troponin I to predict respiratory failure in children admitted to the hospital with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections. We enrolled a prospective convenience sample of children under 5 years of age who were admitted to our university-based, tertiary care children's hospital from December 1, 2000, to February 1, 2002, with RSV infections. A cardiac troponin I was drawn at admission. We assessed the test characteristics for positive cardiac troponin I (defined as >0.3 ng/mL, the manufacturer's upper limit of normal) in correctly identifying children who had respiratory failure as evidenced by the need for endotracheal intubation. Twenty-five children from 9 days to 38 months of age were included. Ten children had a positive cardiac troponin I and 3 of these children had respiratory failure. A positive cardiac troponin I demonstrated a sensitivity of 100%, specificity 68%, positive predictive value of 30%, negative predictive value of 100%, and accuracy of 72%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.939 (95% confidence interval, 0.820-1.0), suggesting a high degree of discriminatory power in selecting children with respiratory failure. A sample size calculation revealed that a follow-up study of 359 patients is needed before the clinical use of cardiac troponin I for this purpose.  2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

243,"New strategies for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is the main cause of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in newborns in the first two years of life. RSV disease has a traditional seasonal trend, with an onset and offset, duration and peak. Prematurity, male gender, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), critical congenital cardiovascular disorders (CCHD), neuromuscular diseases, congenital and inherited airways anatomical anomalies are the main risk factors for increased severity of this infection. RSV infection is associated with negative long-term respiratory outcomes, with excess of morbidity, resulting in reduced quality of life of the infected children and representing a burden for the healthcare costs and resources. Despite all the efforts, prevention remains, to date, the most effective strategy to reduce RSV-related morbidity. Among the current prevention strategies, strict hygiene, breastfeeding and passive immunization with the monoclonal antibody Palivizumab are the cornerstone. In the next future, it is likely that new possibilities of prevention will add, including use of more potent and longer-acting monoclonal antibodies, implementation of maternal vaccination in pregnancy, and active immunization in children. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the main current and future prevention strategies against RSV.

A positive pertussis-PCR was found in 14/90 (16%) infants infected with RSV and in 5/30 negative for RSV. Similar clinical symptoms were found in all RSV-positive infants with or without pertussis co-infection. Most infants (73%) were not vaccinated against pertussis, and the other children had received one or two injections.

782,"Respiratory syncytial virus infection in elderly and high-risk adults BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an increasingly recognized cause of illness in adults. Data on the epidemiology and clinical effects in community-dwelling elderly persons and high-risk adults can help in assessing the need for vaccine development. METHODS: During four consecutive winters, we evaluated all respiratory illnesses in prospective cohorts of healthy elderly patients (65 years of age) and high-risk adults (those with chronic heart or lung disease) and in patients hospitalized with acute cardiopulmonary conditions. RSV infection and influenza A were diagnosed on the basis of culture, reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, and serologic studies. RESULTS: A total of 608 healthy elderly patients and 540 high-risk adults were enrolled in prospective surveillance, and 1388 hospitalized patients were enrolled. A total of 2514 illnesses were evaluated. RSV infection was identified in 102 patients in the prospective cohorts and 142 hospitalized patients, and influenza A was diagnosed in 44 patients in the prospective cohorts and 154 hospitalized patients. RSV infection developed annually in 3 to 7 percent of healthy elderly patients and in 4 to 10 percent of high-risk adults. Among healthy elderly patients, RSV infection generated fewer office visits than influenza; however, the use of health care services by high-risk adults was similar in the two groups. In the hospitalized cohort, RSV infection and influenza A resulted in similar lengths of stay, rates of use of intensive care (15 percent and 12 percent, respectively), and mortality (8 percent and 7 percent, respectively). On the basis of the diagnostic codes of the international Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification at discharge, RSV infection accounted for 10.6 percent of hospitalizations for pneumonia, 11.4 percent for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 5.4 percent for congestive heart failure, and 7.2 percent for asthma. CONCLUSIONS: RSV infection is an important illness in elderly and high-risk adults, with a disease burden similar to that of nonpandemic influenza A in a population in which the prevalence of vaccination for influenza is high. An effective RSV vaccine may offer benefits for these adults. Copyright  2005 Massachusetts Medical Society. (Falsey A.R., ann.falsey@viahealth.org; Hennessey P.A.; Formica M.A.; Walsh E.E.)

48,"Increased Risk of Hospitalization for Pneumonia in Italian Adults from 2010 to 2019: Scientific Evidence for a Call to Action Background: Understanding trends in pneumonia-associated hospitalizations can help to quantify the burden of disease and identify risk conditions and at-risk populations. This study evaluated characteristics of hospitalizations due to pneumonia that occurred in Italy in a 10-year period from 2010 to 2019. Methods: All hospitalizations with a principal or secondary diagnosis of pneumonia over the 10-year period were included, which were identified by hospital discharges for all-cause pneumonia and pneumococcal pneumonia in the anonymized hospital discharge database of the Italian Health Ministry. Results: A total of 2,481,213 patients were hospitalized for pneumonia between 2010 and 2019; patients aged 7586 years accounted for 30.1% of hospitalizations. Most hospitalizations (88.1%) had an unspecified pneumonia discharge code. In-hospital death was recorded in 13.0% of cases. The cumulative cost for pneumonia hospitalizations of the 10-year period were EUR 11,303,461,591. Over the observation period, the incidence rate for hospitalized all-cause pneumonia in any ages increased from 100 per 100,000 in 2010 to over 160 cases per 100,000 per year in 2019 (p < 0.001). Overall, there was a significant increase in annual percent changes in hospitalization rates (+3.47 per year), in-hospital death (+4.6% per year), and costs (+3.95% per year) over the 10-year period. Conclusions: Our analysis suggests that hospitalizations for pneumonia are increasing over time in almost all age groups, especially in the elderly. Given the substantial burden of pneumonia in terms of mortality, healthcare resources, and economic costs, greater public health efforts should thus be made to promote vaccinations against influenza and pneumococcus, particularly in high-risk groups.

426,"Prophylaxis for respiratory syncytial virus with respiratory syncytial virus-immunoglobulin intravenous among preterm infants of thirty-two weeks gestation and less: Reduction in incidence, severity of illness and cost Objective. To determine the impact of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) prophylaxis among preterm infants of 32 weeks gestation by comparing the severity of illness and cost of RSV-related care during the two winter seasons before (1994 to 1995, 1995 to 1996) with the two seasons after initiation of prophylaxis (1996 to 1997, 1997 to 1998). Methods. Preterm infants of 32 weeks gestation at risk for hospitalization with RSV infection were identified retrospectively from the infants hospitalized in our neonatal units. Infants were included if they (1) were born 6 months before or during four winter seasons (1994 to 1998), (2) were discharged from the neonatal unit and (3) had remained in the university outpatient clinic system during at least the first winter of life. Preterm infants of 32 weeks gestation hospitalized with RSV were identified from our RSV database (which includes cost of hospitalization, duration of hospital stay, pediatric intensive care unit stay and intubation). Infants receiving prophylaxis were identified prospectively. Results. The incidence of hospitalization with RSV was significantly lower among the cohort of infants born after initiation of prophylaxis: 8.7% (17 of 195) vs. 22% (35 of 159), P = 0.00049 by two tailed Fisher's exact test. Among the cohort of infants born after initiation of prophylaxis (n = 195), 100 infants received prophylaxis. The gestational and chronologic ages of the prophylaxis-treated infants were significantly lower than those of the non-prophylaxis-treated infants (n = 95). The prophylaxis- treated infants also were more likely to have bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Only 1 (1%) of the prophylaxis-treated infants required hospitalization for RSV. Comparison of the cohort of infants born before initiation of prophylaxis to the cohort born after initiation of prophylaxis (includes prophylaxis-treated and non-prophylaxis-treated infants) revealed a significant reduction in severity of illness and cost. The length of stay in the cohort born before initiation of prophylaxis was reduced 83.8%: 373.6 days per 100 infants at risk vs. 60.5 (P = 0.00055). The length of stay in the pediatric intensive care unit was reduced 92.7%: 218.2 days per 100 infants at risk vs. 15.9 (P = 0.00029). The duration of intubation was reduced 95.6%: 187.4 days per 100 infants at risk vs. 8.2 (P = 0.00024). The dollars spent for RSV-related care (hospitalizations and prophylaxis) per 100 infants at risk for RSV was reduced 65% in the cohort of infants born after prophylaxis: $670 590 per 100 infants at risk vs. $234 596 (P = 0.00056). This reduction remained significant (64.9%) if the cost of ribavirin (drug and administration fees) was excluded from the cost of hospitalization. Conclusions. These data reveal that RSV prophylaxis significantly reduced the incidence of RSV hospitalizations and severity of illness as well as the cost of RSV-related care among these infants.

245,"High frequency oscillatory ventilation in severe RSV infection High frequency oscillatory (HFOV) has been progressively useful in children with severe hypoxemic and hypercapnic respiratory insufficiency, at Pediatric Intensive Care Units. Objectives: To describe our experience in treatment of children with severe RSV infection unresponsive to conventional ventilation (CV), to describe effectiveness in gas exchange and to evaluate the safety of the method. A descriptive and prospective study set at two paediatric intensive care units, in Hospital Roberto del Rio and Clinica Santa Maria of Santiago, Chile between January 2001 and December 2004. Results: 36 patients between 0.5 and 10 months of age with severe RSV infection and respiratory failure unresponsive to mechanical ventilation were connected to HFOV after an average time of conventional ventilation of 2.6 days. Arterial pH improved during the first hour in HFOV from 7.18 to > 7.3. Initial PaO (2)/FiO(2) in average was 104.8, there was a slow and progressive improvement until 72 hours (138). FiO(2) diminished since an average of 74% till 63.6% at 72 hours pCO(2) went down from an average of 88 mm de Hg pre HFOV to 50 mmHg at 12 hours, remaining low. Oxygenation index, preHFOV, was in average 18 and it maintained in 17 at 72 hours, with a FiO(2) < 60%. Patients were hold in HFOV between 2-18 days. 3/36 patients died after 1.5, 4 and 18 days of HFOV. 8,3% presented air leak. One of these patients is oxygen dependent after 12 months of following. Conclusions: High frequency oscillatory ventilation is a useful method in the management of acute respiratory failure in children with severe infection for RSV unresponsive to conventional ventilation. It can improve gas exchange slowly and progressively with a low risk of air leak, secuelae and death. (Yanez P L., lyanez@csm.cl; Lapadula A M.)

804,"Severe Clinical Outcomes Among Adults Hospitalized With Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections, New York City, 2017-2019 Objectives: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes substantial morbidity and mortality in older adults. We assessed severe clinical outcomes among hospitalized adults that were associated with RSV infections. Methods: We performed a nested retrospective study in 3 New York City hospitals during 2 respiratory viral seasons, October 2017April 2018 and October 2018April 2019, to determine the proportion of patients with laboratory-confirmed RSV infection who experienced severe outcomes defined as intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, and/or death. We assessed factors associated with these severe outcomes and explored the effect of RSV-associated hospitalizations on changes in the living situations of surviving patients. Results: Of the 403 patients studied (median age, 69 years), 119 (29.5%) were aged 80. Severe outcomes occurred in 19.1% of patients, including ICU admissions (16.4%), mechanical ventilation (12.4%), and/or death (6.7%). Patients admitted from residential living facilities had a 4.43 times higher likelihood of severe RSV infection compared with patients who were living in the community with or without assistance from family or home health aides. At discharge, 56 (15.1%) patients required a higher level of care than at admission. Conclusions: RSV infection was associated with severe outcomes in adults. Living in a residential facility at admission was a risk factor for severe outcomes and could be a proxy for frailty rather than an independent risk factor. Our data support the development of prevention strategies for RSV infection in older populations, especially older adults living in residential living facilities.

457,"Adults face increased asthma risk after infant RSV bronchiolitis and reduced respiratory health-related quality of life after RSV pneumonia Aim To evaluate the association between hospitalisation for respiratory syncytial virus lower respiratory tract infection (RSV LRTI) in infancy and asthma, respiratory health-related quality of life and lung function at 28-31 years of age. Methods In 2010, we carried out a 30-year follow-up on 43 adults admitted to Kuopio University Hospital, Finland, for RSV LRTI, 27 for bronchiolitis and 16 for pneumonia, between 1981 and 1982. Together with 86 population-based controls, they completed the Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire and underwent prebronchodilator (pre-BD) and post-BD spirometry tests to measure percentage of predicted forced vital capacity (FVC%), percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1%) and percentage of predicted FEV1/FVC (FEV1/FVC%). Results Both the pre-BD and post-BD FEV1% and FEV1/FVC% were significantly lower in former RSV LRTI patients than in the controls. The bronchiolitis patients had more asthma in adulthood than the controls and pneumonia in infancy was associated with lower St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) scores. Conclusion Respiratory tract infection LRTI hospitalisation in infancy was associated with an increased risk of permanent obstructive lung function reduction in adulthood. The asthma risk was higher after hospitalisation for bronchiolitis, than in the controls, and respiratory health-related quality of life was lower after hospitalisation for pneumonia. 2014 Foundation Acta Pdiatrica.

724,"Respiratory syncytial virus: Spectrum of clinical manifestations and complications in children Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection in infants and young children. Despite its substantial disease burden, no effective vaccine is available. Clinical manifestations of RSV encompass the spectrum of acute upper and lower respiratory tract infection. Hallmarks of the virus are its propensity to progress to lower respiratory disease and to cause disproportionate disease severity at extremes of ages. Acute RSV infection may be complicated by secondary bacterial infections and respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and prolonged hospitalization. In the developed world, most RSV infections are self-limited; however, globally, RSV is a significant cause of mortality in children younger than age 5 years. Severe RSV infection in infancy has also been associated with the development of childhood asthma. Thus, the extensive disease burden of RSV and its attributable mortality portend the urgency of vaccine development targeted toward populations disproportionately affected by severe disease.

262,"ResQ Family: Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Infection in Infants and Quality of Life of FamiliesStudy Protocol of a Multi-Country Family Cohort Study (1) Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in infants not only affects the child itself, but also their families. Nevertheless, information on the overall impact is scarce. A comprehensive caregiver-specific approach covering essential (health) dimensions and relevant stakeholders was initiated under the ResQ Family study conducted in Germany, France, Italy and Sweden. The primary objective is to investigate the health-related quality of life of parents and/or caregivers of children (<24 months) hospitalised for RSV. (2) Each participant completes an online questionnaire disseminated via social media and printed material in hospitals. Using the PedsQL(TM) FIM as well as further self-designed questions, parent and patient characteristics as well as potential stressors and preventive factors are recorded at baseline and after six weeks. Multivariate regression models with health-related quality of life as main outcome parameter will be conducted. (3) The study is currently in the recruitment process. A full analysis will be performed once the data collection phase is complete. First results are to be expected in late 2023. (4) Publishing the results in the form of scientific papers but also non-scientific (information) material will help us raise awareness for RSV and the importance of prevention among healthcare professionals, patient representatives and decision-makers.
